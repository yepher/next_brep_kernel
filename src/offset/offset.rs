/// Why it is exact. A revolution's normal lies in the meridian plane and equals
/// the generatrix's own in-plane normal there, so the offset surface IS the
/// revolution of the offset generatrix, and the offset of a circle arc of
/// radius `r` about `c` is the concentric arc of radius `r ± d`. On the net:
/// row `i` of a revolution's control net is an AFFINE image `A_i` of the
/// generatrix's controls — a rotation for the on-circle rows, but a rotation
/// STRETCHED radially by `1/cos` of the half-span for the mid rows, which is
/// not a similarity. Affine maps commute with scaling about a point, so scaling
/// row `i` about `C_i = A_i(c)` by `(r ± d)/r` is exactly `A_i` applied to the
/// offset circle's net; that commutation is the only reason the stretched rows
/// come out right. `C_i` is found without reading `A_i` at all: `c` is an affine
/// combination of three generatrix controls, and the same combination of row
/// `i`'s controls is `A_i(c)`. Knots, degrees and weights are untouched, so the
/// same `(u, v)` still names the corresponding point and cloned trims land
/// where they did, as on [`sphere_offset_surface`].
///
/// Everything is computed and then tested, never claimed. The generatrix is
/// row 0 of the net, and it must lie on one circle to rounding. The sign and
/// size of the move come from the same [`OffsetEvaluator`] the fit samples,
/// read at a generatrix point against the circle's centre: the move must be
/// radial and exactly `|d|` long, and an offset through the centre (`r − d ≤
/// 0`, where the offset circle turns inside out) declines. The finished net
/// must land on the pointwise offset everywhere on the measurement grid, to
/// `1e-9` of the model's scale. Every decline falls through to the fit.

/// ([`OFFSET_FIT_REFINEMENTS`]), when a round stops improving, or when the next
/// net would pass the solver ceilings, is ACCEPTED as its best measured round if
/// that round is inside `offset_construction_band` — the allowance every
