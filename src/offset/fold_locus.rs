//! The FOLD LOCUS: the curve `1 − δ·κ = 0` in a surface's `(u, v)` domain,
//! traced rather than merely bracketed.
//!
//! `offset/regularity.rs` answers a yes/no question about a region — does the
//! equidistant surface fold anywhere in it — by censusing the sign of the fold
//! factor over a derived sample grid.  When a region is folded in PART, that
//! census brackets the boundary between the two halves on its own grid edges
//! and then throws the bracket away.  This module marches it out.
//!
//! # The field
//!
//! One scalar field, [`crate::offset_regularity::fold_sample_at`], shared with
//! the scan so the trace and the census cannot disagree about the same face:
//!
//! ```text
//! g(u, v) = min over the requested displacements δ and both principal
//!           curvatures κ of (1 − δ·κ)   −   level
//! ```
//!
//! with δ along the parametrization normal `Su × Sv` and κ signed against that
//! same normal, exactly as the scan states it.  `level` is the caller's: the
//! carve passes its own collapse factor so the kept side of the split is
//! precisely the side the census calls regular, and a closed-form test passes
//! `0.0` to get the textbook locus.
//!
//! # The march
//!
//! Seeds are sign changes on the SCAN'S OWN grid edges — [`region_grid`] is
//! extracted for that reason, so "the scan can already bracket the fold" is
//! literally true and not approximately.  Each seed is bisected onto `g = 0`,
//! then the curve is followed by predictor–corrector in a normalized `(û, v̂)`
//! box: predict along the tangent `(−g_v, g_u)`, correct back along `∇g` by
//! Newton.  Working in box-normalized coordinates is what makes one step size
//! meaningful on a domain whose two parameters have unrelated scales.
//!
//! An open branch is marched in both directions from its seed and ends on the
//! box boundary, where a final 1-D Newton along that boundary edge places the
//! endpoint exactly on the locus instead of wherever the last step landed.
//!
//! # What it refuses, and why that matters more than what it traces
//!
//! A fold locus that is silently wrong is a trim split in the wrong place,
//! which is a wrong solid that validates.  So every way of losing the curve is
//! a named refusal carrying the `(u, v)` where it was lost:
//!
//! * **stationary field** — `|∇g|` under the floor: a bracket led somewhere the
//!   level set has no direction to follow, so there is no curve there to
//!   march.  (A field that is constant over the WHOLE region, as a torus
//!   offset past its tube radius is on its meridian branch, brackets nothing in
//!   the first place and comes back empty — that is not this refusal.);
//! * **a jump, not a crossing** — the bisection converges on a parameter where
//!   `|g|` is still large.  A knot line across which the curvature jumps (a
//!   line → arc → line sheet) changes the sign of `g` without ever passing
//!   through zero, and marching such a "locus" would follow the knot line;
//! * **the corrector left the locus** — Newton did not return, after halving;
//! * **the march ran away** — neither closed nor left the domain in budget.
//!
//! None of these is downgraded to an empty result: an empty [`FoldLocus`] means
//! "there is no fold locus here", which is a different claim.
