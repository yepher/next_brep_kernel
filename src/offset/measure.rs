//! Measured tolerance for offset constructions — the deviation OBSERVED
//! between a built entity and the geometry it was built to reproduce.
//!
//! # What this module is
//!
//! [`crate::MeasuredTolerance`] is the vocabulary; this is the offset family's
//! measurement. Two quantities, one per construction kind:
//!
//! * [`measure_edge_against_pcurve_image`] — for a rim/trim edge built by
//!   sampling a pcurve through a surface and interpolating the images:
//!   `max_t ‖C_3d(t) − S(p(t))‖`. This is the number that makes the offset
//!   family's tolerance measured rather than predicted — the size-derived band
//!   stays the acceptance bar the caller gates on, and this observed deviation
//!   is what gets recorded — and the analogue of OCCT's
//!   `BRepOffset_SimpleOffset::FillEdgeData`
//!   (`BRepOffset_SimpleOffset.cxx:296-310`), which sets the edge tolerance to
//!   exactly this distance measured with `BRepLib_ValidateEdge`.
//! * [`measure_surface_fit_against_pointwise_offset`] — for a carrier built by
//!   collocation: `max_{u,v} ‖S_fit(u,v) − offset(u,v)‖`. Nothing in this tree
//!   has ever measured our Greville fit against the pointwise offset it
//!   interpolates; this does.
//!
//! Plus [`vertex_endpoint_gap`], the endpoint half of the edge → vertex
//! propagation whose rule (and whose verdict on OCCT's 1.001 factor) lives on
//! [`crate::vertex_tolerance_from_edges`].
//!
//! # Why the edge measurement is `adaptive_coedge_error` PLUS a span pass
//!
//! `brep/topology/validate.rs:453` already computes `max_s ‖S(q(s)) − c(t(s))‖`
//! over an adaptive subdivision, seam-aware through `evaluate_extended`, and it
//! is what [`crate::BrepSolid::validate`] itself runs on every coedge. Writing a
//! second sampler from scratch would produce a second answer to one question —
//! the failure the offset-unification audit spent five slices removing — so it
//! is kept as the general backstop and its band-driven refinement is passed
//! through exactly as validate passes `pcurve_limit`.
//!
//! **But it is not sufficient here, and this was measured, not assumed.** Its
//! sample set is 32 uniform intervals bisected to depth 3, i.e. the DYADIC grid
//! of multiples of 1/256. Every 3D curve `offset_face_carrier` built when this
//! was written came from `mapped_pcurve_polyline`, whose adaptive subdivision
//! bisects the same interval and therefore places its interpolation nodes on
//! the dyadic grid too (up to 1024 of them at its depth cap,
//! `offset/offset.rs:560`). Once the polyline is finer than 1/256, **every one
//! of the sampler's points is an interpolation node**, where a degree-1
//! interpolant is exact by construction. (Since 2026-09-06 the carrier builds
//! its edges through the `image_curve` ladder and reaches that polyline only
//! as the ladder's fallback — `offset.rs::carrier_edge_curve` — but the
//! fallback, and any degree-1 curve a caller transfers, is measured here the
//! same way.)
//! Measured on a 1200-long cylinder's cap rim: `adaptive_coedge_error` answers
//! `8.0e-14`; a dense scan of the same comparison answers `2.356e-3`. Ten orders
//! of magnitude, and the aliasing gets WORSE the finer the curve. (The same
//! blind spot is in `BrepSolid::validate`, which runs the same sampler over the
//! same curves — recorded in the study doc, not fixed here.)
//!
//! So the measurement adds [`span_midpoint_error`]: one sample at the MIDPOINT
//! of each of the curve's own knot spans. For a degree-1 interpolant — the
//! construction's fallback curve — the deviation from the smooth image is
//! zero at the nodes and extremal inside the span, so a midpoint per span is not
//! a heuristic, it is the right estimator for this construction class. The
//! recorded deviation is the maximum of the two passes: a general backstop that
//! can see between spans, and a span pass that cannot be aliased away.
//!
//! A caller transferring a HIGHER-degree curve (the general pcurve → 3D image
//! curve the `image_curve` ladder interpolates as a cubic once neither its
//! affine nor its iso tier applies) needs both for the opposite reason: a
//! cubic's worst point is not generally the span midpoint, so the adaptive pass
//! carries that case and the span pass only floors it.
//!
//! Cost is bounded by the curve's own span count plus one validate pass — a
//! ceiling this kernel already pays on every offset result.
//!
//! # The direction rule
//!
//! Everything here RECORDS. Nothing here widens a band. See
//! [`crate::MeasuredTolerance`]'s "direction rule".
