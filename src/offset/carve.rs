//! CARVE the folded part out of a trim.
//!
//! `offset/regularity.rs` decides whether a trimmed region folds; `offset/
//! fold_locus.rs` traces the curve `1 − δ·κ = 0` that separates the part that
//! does from the part that does not.  This module is what the two are for: it
//! divides the trim along that curve, keeps every regular piece, and hands the
//! caller back the folded ones so they can be reported and the new boundaries
//! re-solved against their neighbours.
//!
//! # Where the crossings come from
//!
//! Not from intersecting two polylines.  The trim boundary and the locus are
//! both approximations in parameter space, and their polyline intersection
//! inherits both errors.  Instead the FIELD is evaluated along each trim
//! pcurve: a crossing is a zero of `1 − δ·κ(pcurve(t)) − level` in the
//! pcurve's own parameter, found by bisection and refined by Newton, so the
//! split point is exact in the one coordinate the split actually uses — the
//! parameter [`NurbsCurve::split`] is given.  The traced locus then only has to
//! supply the SHAPE of the bridge between two points it already passes through.
//!
//! # Any number of chords
//!
//! Each stretch of a branch that lies inside the trim, between two boundary
//! crossings, is a CHORD of the trim, and k non-crossing chords divide it into
//! k + 1 pieces.  One chord is the plain split: one regular piece, one folded.
//! TWO chords are a fold BAND across the trim — a torus offset past its inner
//! equator is the standard one — and they leave THREE pieces, the band in the
//! middle and a regular piece on either side of it.  A trim whose boundary
//! weaves across one fold parallel cuts as many chords as it has teeth, and
//! teeth across a band cut two each.  The division is built by recursion: take
//! one chord, it splits the cycle in two, every other chord lies wholly inside
//! one of them, and each side is the same problem with fewer chords.
//!
//! There is no cap on k.  There was one, two, until 2026-09-17, and its only
//! reason was that two was what the fixtures had measured; the recursion was
//! general, and so is the census below that verifies what it builds.  k is
//! bounded by the trim itself — every chord owns two crossings, and a crossing
//! is a sign change between two consecutive boundary samples, so k is at most
//! half the samples [`boundary_crossings`] takes — and each piece costs two
//! scans, so the work grows linearly in k.  Combs of three, four and eight
//! chords on a torus sheet read every kept piece on its Pappus volume and area
//! (`thicken.rs`, fixtures 17–19, and the 2026-09-17 carve record).
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! A CLOSED branch — the fold cutting a HOLE out of the trim — is refused: the
//! kept region would carry a new inner loop whose offset image is a
//! self-touching rim, and nothing downstream re-solves that rim.  So is a
//! branch that crosses the boundary an odd number of times (a crossing the sign
//! change missed, or a tangency counted once), a crossing that bounds no stretch
//! of its branch inside the trim, and two branches that CROSS inside the trim.
//! Each is refused BY NAME with the counts it saw.  A carve that guesses at a
//! configuration it cannot resolve produces a trim that still validates and
//! bounds the wrong solid, which is the one outcome this family of code exists
//! to prevent.
//!
//! # The check that makes the result trustworthy
//!
//! The division is verified against the same scan that asked for it: EVERY
//! piece is censused, and each must come back either with no collapsed sample
//! or with nothing but collapsed samples, judged a band off the traced level so
//! the new boundaries themselves do not vote.  At least one piece of each kind
//! has to appear.  A division the scan disagrees with is refused, not shipped.
