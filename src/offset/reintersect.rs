//! The ONE definition of "re-intersect two carriers to remake a trim boundary".
//!
//! # What this is, and where it sits in the offset-unification plan
//!
//! The audit splits the shared machinery into three: offsetting a surface
//! pointwise ([`crate::OffsetEvaluator`], `offset/point.rs`, slice 1),
//! re-trimming a face whose boundary has already moved (`offset/retrim.rs`,
//! slice 2), and **intersecting carriers to remake the boundary in the first
//! place** — the step that has to happen *between* those two, and the one
//! push-face did not have in general form. §2.3's matrix is the work list:
//! offset-shell re-intersects arbitrary carriers, push-face refuses most
//! neighbour classes.
//!
//! # Why this is not an extraction of offset-shell's arrangement
//!
//! §5's Slice 3 proposes exposing "replace one face's carrier and re-derive the
//! incident trim by imprint arrangement, extracted from `offset_shell_impl`",
//! and rates its own confidence in a clean extraction low. Read, not assumed:
//! `offset_shell_impl` is a first-attempt/retry driver over *whole solids*
//! whose fragment selection (`point_on_offset_skin`) asserts that every kept
//! point sits at the full offset distance from **every** retained source face —
//! an invariant that is simply false when one face of a solid is pushed. There
//! is nothing in that pipeline a single-face push can consume without first
//! deleting the invariant that makes it work.
//!
//! What offset-shell actually does at the level a push needs is one step lower,
//! in the imprint driver it calls: **try the recognized analytic pair first,
//! fall back to the marched surface/surface intersection** — `driver.rs:225`
//! (`intersect_analytic_pair`) then `driver.rs:398` (`intersect_surfaces`) then
//! `driver.rs:644` (`fit_polyline`). That two-lane structure is the generality;
//! the arrangement around it is offset-shell's own bookkeeping.
//!
//! `intersect_analytic_pair`'s own contract already names the fallback —
//! "*or `None` when the pair is not handled and the caller must fall back to
//! SSI marching*" (`geometry/analytic_surface/intersect.rs:73-75`). Push-face
//! read `None` as a refusal. That misreading **is** the capability gap.
//!
//! # Conventions, made explicit rather than baked in
//!
//! Slice 1 found that a shared helper with one hard-coded convention silently
//! moves a caller (audit §9.6.2), and slices 2 and 2b carried that forward as
//! an explicit pcurve fit lane (since retired: that lane's planar/ruled split
//! turned out to be a defect, not a convention) and `OffsetPairDegeneracy`.
//! The same discipline here:
//!
//! * **The analytic lane is bit-identical to calling
//!   [`crate::intersect_analytic_pair`] directly**, with the same arguments in
//!   the same order. A caller that only ever reaches analytic pairs gets
//!   exactly the curves it got before this module existed — which is what the
//!   bit-identity probe measures.
//! * **Refusals are values, not strings** ([`ReintersectRefusal`]). Every push
//!   path already has its own wording for "the push separated the carriers";
//!   a shared form that emitted its own text would have moved their tests.
//! * **The marched lane is residual-gated and the gate is the caller's.** A
//!   fitted section is an approximation; the caller says how much drift its
//!   operation may ship. There is no default, because the right number is
//!   different for a boolean imprint and for a push that must re-validate a
//!   solid.
//! * **Branch selection is never made here.** Both lanes return every branch
//!   they found, in their own order. Which one is *this* rim, and which way it
//!   must run, is decided at the site from the boundary it is replacing.
