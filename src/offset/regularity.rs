//! Region-scoped offset REGULARITY — one definition of "does the equidistant
//! surface fold over THIS trimmed region", shared by `thicken`'s sheet gate and
//! `offset_shell`'s carrier-collapse lane.
//!
//! The condition itself is the classical one and neither caller changes it:
//! moving a surface by `δ` along its parametrization normal `n = Su × Sv`
//! scales the area element, per principal direction, by `1 − δ·κ` with `κ`
//! signed against that same normal ([`NurbsSurface::principal_curvatures`]).
//! The offset folds through the evolute where that factor reaches zero.
//!
//! What this module changes is WHERE the condition is asked.  Both callers used
//! to sweep a fixed grid over the whole surface DOMAIN, which answers about the
//! carrier and not about the face: a cone's apex row rejected a sheet trimmed to
//! the cone's wide end, and a fold narrower than the grid step INSIDE the trim
//! was not seen at all.  Here the samples are laid over the trim's own parameter
//! region, and their density is derived rather than fixed:
//!
//! * **Per knot span.**  A NURBS surface is one rational polynomial patch per
//!   knot span, so curvature cannot spike between spans without the spike living
//!   inside one.  Every span the region touches therefore gets its own samples,
//!   and a span covering 0.2% of the domain gets as many as one covering half of
//!   it.  A grid uniform over the domain is exactly what steps over the narrow
//!   one.
//! * **Per offset distance.**  Inside one span the fold's own scale is the
//!   offset distance — the fold happens where the curvature RADIUS falls to
//!   `|δ|` — so the arc-length step is additionally capped at a fraction of
//!   `|δ|`, converted to parameter steps through the first fundamental form.
//! * **Plus the trim boundary itself.**  The loop pcurves are sampled directly:
//!   the worst point of a region is often on its rim, and a region small enough
//!   to fall between grid nodes still gets a population this way.
//!
//! Refinement around the worst node sharpens the location that goes into a
//! refusal.  It never votes in the sample census, so the census stays an
//! unbiased population — which is what the shell lane's "collapsed EVERYWHERE in
//! this trim" question needs, and what a refinement biased toward the minimum
//! would quietly destroy.
//!
//! # Between the nodes
//!
//! The census cannot see a fold narrower than its node spacing, and that is
//! not hypothetical: on a free-form patch it let the carve keep a piece with a
//! folded ISLAND inside it (factor −2.1e-3, 0.03 across, between nodes 0.028
//! apart), which `thicken` then refused only as a self-intersecting result.
//! [`refine_between_nodes`] looks inside every grid cell whose corners agree but
//! read close to the level against the slope their neighbourhood shows, halving
//! the riskiest cells first. What it finds is reported beside the census
//! (`between_collapsed`, `between_regular`), never in it, and it seeds the fold
//! trace so an island comes back as the closed branch it is.
//!
//! What this does NOT do: no finite sampling can PROVE a region regular, and the
//! refinement's slope is estimated from the very nodes an island hides between.
//! So the claim is a measurement, on the island family in this module's tests
//! (an island is the folded top of a bump, at every width and depth the family
//! reaches, placed on a knot halfway between nodes or at random): with the SHEET
//! budget every island at least **0.02 of the node spacing** wide is caught, where
//! the grid alone missed 14 of those at least 0.1 wide; with SHELL_FACE every
//! island at least **0.25 of the node spacing** is. A narrower island is missed
//! when the nodes round it read far from the level (0.5 and more on the misses
//! measured — nothing computed from those nodes can see it), or when it is
//! narrower than the finest cell, `2⁻⁷` of the node spacing. The refinement has
//! no evaluation budget to run out of: each risky cell costs at most
//! `5·(4⁷ − 1)/3` = 27,305 samples, so it always finishes, and nothing it did
//! not reach is reported regular. What it costs on the lib, integration and
//! case populations is in the 2026-09-17 record. Away from the between-node question
//! the density rules still hold: a fold has to hide inside a single knot span,
//! below the `|δ|`-derived arc-length step, and away from the rim, to be missed.
