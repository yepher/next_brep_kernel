//! A fold BAND on a FULL revolution: the half-plane union, revolved.
//!
//! A thicken is the UNION of the sheet's normal segments. When the sheet is a
//! surface of REVOLUTION and the offset reaches the axis, the segments in the
//! folded band cross it and come out the other side — at the azimuth half a turn
//! away. Dropping that band bounds LESS than the sheet sweeps, which is what the
//! fold-band slice refused; carving it is not the answer, and neither is a
//! per-piece volume fitted to the construction.
//!
//! ## The construction
//!
//! For a FULL revolution the far side of every segment lands at an azimuth the
//! sheet itself covers, so the union is again a solid of REVOLUTION and the
//! whole question is planar. In the meridian half-plane, with the tube centre
//! `T` at distance `R` from the axis and the segments running `s ∈ [s_lo, s_hi]`
//! from it over the meridian range `[φ0, φ1]`:
//!
//! ```text
//!     S  = the annular sector  {T + s(cos φ, sin φ) : s ∈ [s_lo, s_hi], φ ∈ [φ0, φ1]}
//!     S' = S ∩ {ρ ≥ 0}                       the part that never left the half-plane
//!     L  = {ρ ≥ 0 : (ρ + R)² + z² ≤ s_hi²}   the REFLECTED lemon — what crossed, folded back
//!     U  = S' ∪ L,  revolved a full turn
//! ```
//!
//! `S ∩ {ρ < 0}` is exactly the disc of radius `s_hi` about `T` cut by the axis
//! (a point with `ρ < 0` has `s > R > s_lo`, and its meridian angle is inside the
//! fold band, which is inside the trim), so `L` is that segment reflected — the
//! LEMON of the spindle `(R, s_hi)`, the same region the swept-envelope lane
//! builds as its far lobe.
//!
//! `L` is not disjoint from `S'`: it reaches into the TUBE HOLE (`s < s_lo`),
//! which `S` never covered. `U = S' ⊔ lens` with `lens = L ∩ {s < s_lo}` — two
//! DISJOINT regions — and that is what makes the closed form a sum rather than
//! an inclusion–exclusion:
//!
//! ```text
//!     V = 2π·[ I(S') + I(lens) ],    I(X) = ∫∫_X ρ dA
//!     I(S)            = Δφ·R(s_hi² − s_lo²)/2 + (s_hi³ − s_lo³)/3·(sin φ1 − sin φ0)
//!     I(S ∩ {ρ<0})    = R·A_seg − (2/3)(s_hi² − R²)^{3/2},  A_seg = s_hi²·acos(R/s_hi) − R√(s_hi²−R²)
//!     I(lens)         = the two circular segments the RADICAL line ρ* = (s_hi² − s_lo²)/(4R) cuts
//! ```
//!
//! The lens is the intersection of two discs whose centres both lie ON the
//! ρ-axis, so their radical line is VERTICAL and the lens splits into one
//! segment of each disc at `ρ*` — no quadrature anywhere in the form.
//!
//! ## What it refuses, by name
//!
//! A PARTIAL revolution above all: there the reflected band lands at azimuths
//! the sheet does not cover, the union is a second BODY rather than a revolve,
//! and there is no planar form to take Pappus on. Also a generatrix that is not
//! a circle, a trim that is not the whole face, a fold that is not a BAND
//! strictly inside the meridian range, and a reflected lemon that reaches
//! material the trim never swept — each with the measurement that decided it.
