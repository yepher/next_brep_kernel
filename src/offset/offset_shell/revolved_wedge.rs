//! An OUTWARD shell of ONE face of a partial REVOLVE, built in the meridian
//! half-plane and revolved once.
//!
//! The configuration: a solid revolved through less than a full turn, whose one
//! RETAINED face is the revolve of a circular arc, every other face opened, and
//! the shell grown outward. A torus band grown past its own major radius is the
//! reason this lane exists: its offset folds in a BAND across the trim, and the
//! imprint pipeline can neither use the carve's three-piece division nor — with
//! the chord of a circular segment as the opening — close the regular case
//! either (measured on 2026-09-17: the same wedge grown by 0.5, no fold
//! anywhere, reads "completion produced non-integral genus", because an outward
//! wall on a CURVED opening face is the unpadded source face and never reaches
//! the grown offset).
//!
//! ## What the shell owes, and why the skin is never carved
//!
//! An outward shell is the grown solid less the source, where the grown solid
//! is the source with its retained faces offset and its OPENED faces held in
//! place, extended along themselves. Everything is planar in the meridian
//! half-plane: with the tube centre `T`, the skin radius `r` and the grown
//! radius `r + |d|`, the region is the annulus between the two circles, cut by
//! the profile's two straight edges at the ends of the arc (extended outward
//! until they meet the grown circle) and by the AXIS.
//!
//! Where the grown circle crosses the axis — `R + (r + |d|)·cos φ < 0`, the
//! fold band — its normals have passed through the axis and come out at the
//! azimuth half a turn away. That REFLECTED part lies in front of both azimuth
//! openings, and an opening removes everything in front of it; so the region
//! stops at the axis, and the two end caps meet along the chord the band cuts
//! there. The SKIN over the band stays: every point between it and the axis is
//! within `|d|` of it along its own outward normal and in front of no opening.
//! Carving it away as well would close a shell too — two bodies, each with a
//! pinch cone — and would drop exactly that material: on the R = 3, r = 2 ring
//! grown by 4 the difference is `(π/2)(35√3/3 − 4π)` = 12.00228, and the point
//! ρ = 0.5, z = 0 at the mid azimuth is in neither body. It is the rule the
//! apex-cone carve already ships: the skin whole, the offset trimmed where it
//! collapses.
//!
//! A full-revolution thicken of the same sheet builds `S′ ∪ lemon`
//! (`offset/thicken/band.rs`); this lane builds `S′` clipped by the openings,
//! and the lemon is precisely what the azimuth openings remove.
//!
//! ## What it declines
//!
//! Anything that is not exactly this configuration goes back to the imprint
//! pipeline untouched, with the reason logged under `BREP_OS_DEBUG`: an inward
//! shell, more than one retained face, a full revolution, a generatrix that is
//! not a circle, a trim that is not the whole face, material outside the tube, a
//! neighbouring profile edge that is not straight, an extended edge that does
//! not leave the tube or that reaches the axis, two extended edges that cross,
//! and a fold that reaches an END of the grown arc rather than lying inside it —
//! that last is the carve's single-chord lane, and it keeps it.
