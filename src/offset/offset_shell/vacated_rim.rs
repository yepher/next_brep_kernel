//! Closing the boundary a shadowed support's removal VACATED on the neighbour
//! that survives it.
//!
//! When two wall offsets cross — a slot narrower than twice the distance, grown
//! outward — each lies wholly inside the other's material, so neither owns any
//! skin and both supports are omitted (`offset_shell/pipeline.rs`). The crossing
//! is trimmed by that omission. What is left is the rim those faces used to cut
//! in a SURVIVING neighbour's trim: a slot that runs out through a face leaves a
//! notch in that face's own loop, the carrier clones the source's trim notch and
//! all, and an outward carrier grows only across the sides of its parameter box,
//! so nothing closes it. Measured on a 2-wide slot through a 20 cube grown by
//! 1.5: 12 one-use edges where the slot crosses both Y faces.
//!
//! The closure is on the OFFSET side: the CARRIER's trim is bridged, and the
//! source face keeps its notch, because that notch is real material boundary.
//!
//! What it is keyed on is OWNERSHIP, per rim: a run of the loop's coedges whose
//! faces were all omitted as shadowed is replaced by the straight span between
//! its ends. A rim whose face owns skin is never bridged, so a T-shaped slot —
//! a narrow throat over a wide pocket — closes the throat and keeps the pocket,
//! which is what the occupancy integral asks for.
//!
//! Two things it will not do, each refused with what it measured:
//! * a bridge that is not the CONTINUATION of the rims either side of the run
//!   (they are not collinear with the chord in the carrier's parameter space);
//! * a carrier whose trim no longer matches its source loop coedge for coedge,
//!   where the correspondence this reads would be a guess.
//!
//! Planar carriers only. On a curved one the image of a parameter-space segment
//! is not the span of an existing rim, which is the thing being restored.
