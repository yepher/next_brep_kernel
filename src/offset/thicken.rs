//! §5.9 Sheet → solid THICKEN (Golovanov): turn an open surface patch —
//! either its full parameter rectangle or a region TRIMMED by pcurve loops —
//! into a slab solid bounded by the sheet offset on one or both sides plus
//! ruled side walls along every boundary pcurve.
//!
//! The offset carriers come from `offset_surface` (§3.15 equidistant
//! surface), which preserves the source degree / knots / weights — planes
//! stay exact planes and cylinders / spheres / tori stay exact rational
//! carriers.  Because the two sheets share one basis, each side wall is the
//! HOMOGENEOUS ruling between corresponding boundary curves: with equal
//! per-column weights the ruling evaluates to the pointwise segment
//! (1−w)·B(s) + w·T(s), so wall pcurves are exact parameter lines, a planar
//! rectangle thickens to an EXACT box, and a circular hole in a planar sheet
//! grows an EXACT cylindrical tube.
//!
//! Trim loops follow the FaceRecord convention (`validate_uv_wire`): the
//! outer loop runs counter-clockwise in (u, v) and hole loops run clockwise,
//! exactly as they would appear on a `same_sense = true` face.  Each hole
//! adds one handle: the result of thickening a sheet with h holes is a
//! genus-h solid, and the Euler check V − E + F − H = 2(1 − genus) closes.
//!
//! Where the equidistant surface would degenerate over the SELECTED REGION —
//! a concave principal curvature radius smaller than the offset distance folds
//! the offset through its evolute — the builder refuses with an honest `Err`
//! instead of assembling silent garbage.  The question is asked about the
//! trimmed region and not about the whole carrier: a cone whose apex, or a
//! torus whose inner equator, lies outside the selected trim offsets perfectly
//! well over the sheet actually being thickened.
