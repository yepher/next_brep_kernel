//! The ONE definition of "intersect two OFFSET analytic carriers, in closed
//! form" — the *locus*-level offset seam.
//!
//! # Why this is not the pointwise evaluator, and not `intersect_analytic_pair`
//!
//! Slice 1 built [`crate::OffsetEvaluator`] — "where is the offset of THIS
//! surface at THIS `(u, v)`" — and deliberately refused to route the blend's
//! three corner solves through it, because those solves hold neither a surface
//! nor a parameter and what they need back is a whole LOCUS, not a point
//! (audit §9.4). This module is the shape that does fit.
//!
//! The audit's Slice 2b entry proposed
//! `offset_analytic_pair(a: &AnalyticSurface, da, b: &AnalyticSurface, db)`
//! that "hands the pair to the *existing* [`crate::intersect_analytic_pair`]".
//! Read rather than assumed, that plumbing does not exist to be reused here —
//! three separate misfits, all measured in §11 of the audit:
//!
//! 1. **`intersect_analytic_pair` refuses plane × plane by design**
//!    (`geometry/analytic_surface/intersect.rs`, the `(Plane, Plane) => None`
//!    arm and its comment). Plane × plane is the *headline* case — five of the
//!    seven solves collected here.
//! 2. **It takes `&NurbsSurface`, not `&AnalyticSurface`**, and the corner
//!    solves hold neither: they were handed bare normals, an axis point/dir
//!    and a radius by their caller. Routing through it would mean fabricating
//!    NURBS carriers to intersect them.
//! 3. **It returns `Vec<NurbsCurve>` clipped to the operands' finite domains.**
//!    Even the one lane that does answer this module's question —
//!    `cylinder_parallel_plane_lines` — returns two *segments* cut to the
//!    cylinder's `height` band and goes silently empty at `radius − tolerance`,
//!    where the corner solves need infinite lines and a loud refusal. Recovering
//!    a line's point and direction back out of a fitted `NurbsCurve` is strictly
//!    less exact than the 3×3 solve it replaced.
//!
//! So the seam lives here, at `Vec3` level, in the same closed forms the sites
//! already used — not as a router into the surface intersector.
//!
//! # The sign convention, and what it encodes
//!
//! **`distance` is signed ALONG THE CARRIER'S OUTWARD NORMAL**, the same
//! convention slice 1 fixed for [`crate::OffsetEvaluator`]: the offset carrier
//! is `{ p + distance·n̂(p) }`. For a plane that is the plane translated by
//! `distance·n`; for a cylinder wall whose outward normal points AWAY from its
//! axis it is radius `R + distance`, and `R − distance` for a bore wall whose
//! outward normal points at the axis ([`offset_cylinder_radius`]).
//!
//! That one convention makes the convex/concave split VISIBLE instead of
//! hidden in four hand-written sign choices: a **convex** blend's centre locus
//! is the `−r` offset (inside the material) and a **concave** blend's axis is
//! the `+r` offset (out in the void). `mixed_support`'s ball centre and
//! `mixed_curved`'s concave axis differ by exactly that sign and by nothing
//! else — which is why they used opposite-looking `R ∓ r` expressions before.
//!
//! # Root selection is the CALLER's, always
//!
//! A quadratic has two roots and each site's pick encodes its own geometry, so
//! nothing here picks one. [`line_meets_offset_cylinder`] and
//! [`axial_plane_meets_offset_cylinder`] return **both** roots in a fixed
//! ALGEBRAIC order (`(−b − √Δ)/2a` first), never a geometric one. Sorting them
//! nearest-the-corner first, de-duplicating a tangency, and proving a root by
//! the tangency vertices the sequential fillets left behind all stay at the
//! sites, unchanged.
//!
//! # Degeneracies are values, not strings
//!
//! Every refusal is an [`OffsetPairDegeneracy`] variant and every site renders
//! its own wording from it. The corner refusal messages are asserted on by
//! `corner_concave.rs` (`mixed_curved_wall_corner_refusals`,
//! `all_concave_staircase_corner_refuses`, `tilted_concave_vertex_corner_refuses`),
//! so a shared form that emitted its own text would have moved those tests —
//! the same discipline slice 1 applied to orientation and slice 2 to sampling
//! density.
//!
//! # Exactness
//!
//! Every routine here is the arithmetic its site already performed, in the same
//! order, so the switch is **bit-identical** — pinned by the `bit_identical_*`
//! tests below and measured across the corpus by `BREP_OFFSET_PAIR_DIAG`
//! (audit §11.4). Where two sites used *different* algebra for the same
//! geometry they keep two entry points rather than being merged behind a
//! general one: [`axial_plane_meets_offset_cylinder`] uses the `a = 1`
//! quadratic its plane-parallel-to-axis precondition guarantees, and
//! [`line_meets_offset_cylinder`] the general `a = |d̂⊥|²` form. Folding the
//! first into the second would move its roots in the last bits for no gain.
