//! The ONE definition of "re-trim a face whose boundary has already moved".
//!
//! # "Trim" means two different things in this kernel — this is the second one
//!
//! The audit
//! ([offset-unification-audit.md](../../../docs/developer/kernel-plans/offset-unification-audit.md) §3.3)
//! records that "trimming an offset surface to a face" is not one problem but
//! two, with different failure modes and different tolerances:
//!
//! 1. **Parametric-image trimming.** Offset-shell reuses the *source face's own
//!    pcurves verbatim* on the offset carrier (`offset/offset.rs`,
//!    `offset_face_carrier`), which is meaningful only because
//!    `interpolate_tensor` guarantees the offset shares the source's knots and
//!    weights. Where the image is not enough there is a whole rebuild ladder
//!    (`offset/offset_shell/carrier_rebuild.rs`) that re-derives a carrier's
//!    topology from the *surface's own parameter domain* — it never reads an
//!    updated edge curve, and `rebuild_carrier_full_domain` deliberately
//!    *discards* the source trim's interior loops.
//! 2. **Re-trimming after re-intersection.** Push-face, face-move and the
//!    direct-edit heals recompute the 3D boundary first (by closed-form
//!    surface∩surface intersection, or by rigid translation), and then have to
//!    make the carrier and every pcurve agree with the boundary they were
//!    handed.
//!
//! **This module is (2) and only (2).** Nothing here belongs to (1), and the
//! two must not be merged behind one name: (1) trusts a shared basis and works
//! in parameter space; (2) trusts nothing and re-derives parameter space from
//! 3D. `carrier_rebuild.rs` stays where it is for exactly that reason.
//!
//! # The shape all re-trims share
//!
//! Every caller in the tree did the same three things in the same order:
//!
//! * **(a) sample the already-updated boundary** — [`boundary_samples`];
//! * **(b) grow the carrier to cover those samples** — *not* shared, because
//!   the growth is exact per carrier type and each caller owns a different one
//!   (an axis-aligned box in the plane's own frame; an axial prolongation of a
//!   ruled revolution; an axial prolongation of a partial-sweep revolution).
//!   The audit's slice entry asks for exactly this — "unify the *signature*,
//!   keep the per-carrier growth strategy pluggable" — so the solid-side driver
//!   [`retrim_face_in_solid`] takes the growth as a callback;
//! * **(c) rebuild every coedge pcurve from the updated edge curves** —
//!   [`rebuild_loop_pcurves`].
//!
//! # Conventions, made explicit rather than baked in
//!
//! Slice 1 found that a shared evaluator with one hard-coded orientation
//! convention would have silently moved the blend march (audit §9.6.2). The
//! same discipline applies here: every convention these helpers carried
//! implicitly is now a named, documented parameter.
//!
//! * **Boundary sampling is 5 points per edge over `[t0, t1]`, every loop, and
//!   it does NOT skip degenerate edges.** All three original copies agreed on
//!   this; two *other* 5-point boundary loops in the tree
//!   (`feature_pipeline/features/common.rs` and `solvers/assembly_resolve.rs`,
//!   both computing a plane frame's AABB centre) *do* skip degenerate edges.
//!   Those are a different question and are deliberately not routed here.
//! * **The pcurve fit lane is [`PcurveFit`], chosen by the caller.** The planar
//!   lane maps each edge's WHOLE curve; the ruled lane is subrange-aware. That
//!   asymmetry is deliberate and pre-existing: giving the planar lane subrange
//!   awareness "for symmetry" would be a behavioural change, not a refactor.
//! * **The refusal prefix is the caller's `op` string**, so every message keeps
//!   the operation name it has always reported under.
//!
//! # Why this lives under `offset/`
//!
//! Most consumers do not offset anything — `delete_face_and_heal`, the open and
//! closed heals, and `move_faces` are the majority. The home follows the
//! offset-unification plan, which names this module and places it beside slice
//! 1's [`crate::OffsetEvaluator`] (`offset/point.rs`); the owner's thesis names
//! *trimming offset surfaces to faces* as the shared machinery, and the
//! cross-feature trim slices that come next all live in `offset/`. A move to a
//! carrier-neutral home is a rename, not a redesign.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Each item below records the `file:line` whose body it is. Every one is
//! bit-identical to the code it replaced; the only edits were the `op` prefix
//! becoming a parameter and the carrier growth becoming a callback.
