//! 2D sketch constraint solver.
//!
//! Port of the iterative geometric constraint engine that previously lived in
//! the retiring app's `sketchSolver2D` (ConstraintEngine +
//! constraintDefinitions). The numerical behaviour is kept faithful to the
//! original implementation: same constraint residual handling, same pass
//! ordering, same rounding (6 decimals per tidy pass), same distance-target
//! slide/throttle semantics, and the same convergence check based on point
//! state signatures. The rounding is the RELAXATION's: a committed (polished)
//! solve starts its polish from the caller's own digits wherever relaxation
//! left a coordinate on the grid, so a sketch that already satisfies its
//! constraints comes back as it was stored rather than snapped.
//!
//! Constraints round-trip as JSON objects so that solver bookkeeping fields
//! (`status`, `error`, `previousPointValues`, `_previousSolveValue`,
//! `_distanceRequestedTarget`, `_distanceAppliedTarget`,
//! `_distanceThrottleActive`, `_distanceLastAppliedPassToken`,
//! `_linePointDistanceSign`) persist between solves exactly like the previous engine
//! which mutated live objects. Internally the engine parses each constraint
//! into a typed structure once per solve and compares point-state signatures
//! as normalized f64 bit patterns; signature strings are only materialized
//! when they must round-trip through JSON (`previousPointValues`). String
//! equality of the original signatures is equivalent to bit equality here because both
//! use shortest round-trip float formatting with -0 and NaN normalized.
//!
//! # Module map
//!
//! The solver is split into topic submodules (declared with explicit
//! `#[path]` because this root file is itself declared via `#[path]` in
//! `lib.rs`); this root file keeps the shared data model:
//!
//! - [`jsnum`] — JavaScript numeric semantics helpers (rounding, parseFloat/Number
//!   coercions, signature bit patterns, JSON number formatting).
//! - [`hot_constraint`] — `impl HotConstraint`: JSON parse/write-back of one
//!   constraint record and its solver bookkeeping fields.
//! - [`engine`] — `Engine` construction from sketch JSON, point/signature
//!   helpers, constraint dispatch and the iterative relaxation solve loop.
//! - [`constraints_basic`] — the original ported constraint functions
//!   (horizontal/vertical, distance, point-line distance, equal distance,
//!   parallel, perpendicular, angle, coincident, point-on-line, midpoint).
//! - [`constraints_shape`] — point-based shape constraints added in Rust
//!   (tangent incl. splines, spline curvature continuity, concentric,
//!   equal-radius, collinear, symmetric) plus their line/spline/circle
//!   geometry helpers.
//! - [`constraints_foot`] — foot-parameter tangency (`∿`): the stationarity
//!   solve that eliminates the touch parameter, its per-span roots, the
//!   residuals and the relaxation nudges.
//! - [`dof_polish`] — DOF diagnostics (residual atoms, finite-difference
//!   Jacobian, rank/null-space) and the Levenberg-Marquardt exactness polish.
//! - [`api`] — implied-duplicate constraint removal and the public
//!   `solve_sketch` / `solve_sketch_from_json` entry points.
//! - `tests` — the full test suite.
