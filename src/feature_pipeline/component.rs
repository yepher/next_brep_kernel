//! The scene COMPONENT concept — assemblies build-spec §3 / §10 item 2.
//!
//! A component is a rigid group of solids inserted by an ACOMP feature (one per
//! placed instance). Its record carries the owning feature id, the library part
//! name, the rigid instance pose, the fixed (grounded) flag, and an opaque source
//! metadata slot; its member solids are ordinary scene-resident solids whose
//! entity names are NAMESPACED with the owning feature id.
//!
//! # Namespacing — the prefix wraps, nothing else moves
//!
//! Every entity name of a member solid (the solid name, every `face.name`, every
//! `edge.name` — the only named entities in this kernel; vertices carry no names)
//! is prefixed with `{component_id}:` AT THE COMPONENT BOUNDARY, i.e. when the
//! sub-part's solids enter the assembly scene:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Extrude1_top            ->  ACOMP2:Extrude1_top
//!   Extrude1|Extrude1_top[0]->  ACOMP2:Extrude1|Extrude1_top[0]
//! ```
//!
//! INSIDE the namespace the deterministic-naming rules apply UNCHANGED: the
//! names arrive final from the sub-part's own `register_added` passes
//! (`ensure_unique_face_names` + `stamp_derived_edge_names`) and are NEVER
//! re-derived here. Re-running the derived-edge pass after prefixing would
//! rewrite `ACOMP2:A|B[0]` from the prefixed face names (different sort, embedded
//! prefixes) — do not "fix" this by routing members through `register_added`.
//! Two instances of the same part therefore never collide (distinct feature ids),
//! and a nested assembly's already-namespaced members chain naturally:
//! `ACOMP1:Extrude1_top` wrapped by `ACOMP3` becomes `ACOMP3:ACOMP1:Extrude1_top`.
//!
//! # The feature fence (build-spec §3)
//!
//! Solids from ordinary modeling features never belong to a component and behave
//! exactly as before. Component geometry is valid input for constraints and
//! sketch attach/project ONLY; modeling features must cheaply REJECT it —
//! [`SceneMap::is_component_owned`] / [`reject_component_references`] are that
//! predicate (Wave 2 wires the checks into feature resolution).
