//! TF — Transform Face.
//!
//! Carries the selected faces of a single solid by ONE RIGID MOTION — a rotation
//! about a stated pivot followed by a translation — preserving each carrier's
//! shape, and re-intersects the neighbours the motion moves the selection
//! relative to. The motion is the `transform` parameter the transform gizmo
//! edits: dragging an axis or the centre handle writes `position`, dragging a
//! ring writes `rotationEuler`.
//!
//! # The motion
//!
//! `p ↦ pivot + position + R·(p − pivot)`, with `R` the intrinsic XYZ Euler
//! rotation of `rotationEuler` (degrees) — exactly
//! [`common::compose_trs_matrix`]`(position, rotationEuler, [1,1,1], pivot)`, the
//! one feature-transform convention the Transform feature, the assembly pose and
//! the gizmo already speak. The gizmo is drawn at `pivot + position`, which is
//! where the pivot point lands, so a ring drag turns the faces about the handle
//! the user is holding.
//!
//! `scale` has no meaning for a face edit — a scaled carrier is a different
//! surface, not a moved one. The schema's `default_value` omits it, which hides
//! it in the form and in the tool schema, and a document that carries a
//! non-unit scale anyway is refused BY NAME rather than silently ignored.
//!
//! # A rotation is not a mode of a translation — and this feature does not pretend it is
//!
//! [`crate::move_faces`] moves a carrier's POSITION and leaves its normal alone;
//! [`crate::rotate_faces`] moves the normal too, so the neighbour pairs are
//! re-intersected differently and the invariants that let a corner ride rigidly
//! are different invariants (a cone about its own axis is invariant under a
//! rotation and not under a translation). The two primitives stay two roads, and
//! this feature is a DISPATCHER over them, not a third solver:
//!
//! * a pure TRANSLATION (`rotationEuler` is the identity) goes to `move_faces`
//!   with `position` — Move Face's road, unchanged;
//! * a pure ROTATION (`position` is zero) goes to `rotate_faces` about the axis
//!   LINE through `pivot` along the rotation's own axis, by its own angle —
//!   Rotate Face's road, unchanged. `R` is converted to that axis and angle from
//!   the same matrix the compose builds, so the stored Euler angles and the
//!   kernel's Rodrigues rotation are one rotation;
//! * a COMBINED motion is rotate-then-translate: `rotate_faces` about the pivot,
//!   then `move_faces` by `position` on the solid the rotation left. Both are
//!   pure geometry edits that keep every face id, so the second call takes the
//!   same ids the first did.
//!
//! Why not one rigid re-intersection: neither primitive accepts a general rigid
//! motion. `move_faces` takes a vector and builds its rim maps from it (the
//! exact affine for a ruled carrier, the plane × sphere circle); `rotate_faces`
//! takes an axis and an angle and tests carrier invariance against that axis
//! line. A third road accepting a matrix would have to redo both invariance
//! analyses per case, which is precisely the objection the Rotate Face contract
//! raised against a matrix: a matrix names no invariant. Decomposing keeps the
//! invariant each road proves.
//!
//! Why not the screw decomposition (Chasles: any rigid motion is a rotation
//! about SOME axis plus a slide along it, which would fold the in-plane part of
//! `position` into a single `rotate_faces` call): that axis sits at
//! `|position⊥| / (2·sin(θ/2))` from the pivot — metres away for a degree of turn
//! — and it is no longer the selection's own axis, so a coaxial cylinder spun
//! and slid would lose the rigid regime it has about the pivot. The pivot the
//! user stated is the axis the invariance test must see.
//!
//! The price of two calls is an INTERMEDIATE state: the faces rotated but not yet
//! translated. A motion whose end state is buildable can still refuse there (a
//! rotation that alone inverts a neighbour the translation would have restored).
//! Such a refusal is named as the step it happened in — "the rotation step" or
//! "the translation step" — with the primitive's own message after it, so the
//! user reads which half of the motion to change.
//!
//! # The pivot
//!
//! `pivot` is a stored vec3. When it is null the pivot is the SELECTION'S CENTRE,
//! computed by [`selection_centre`] from the feature's INPUT solid: the centre of
//! the axis-aligned bounds of every vertex on the selected faces' boundaries and
//! of each boundary edge sampled at [`CENTRE_SAMPLES`] equal steps across its
//! active parameter range (a face with no edge at all — a closed sphere —
//! contributes its surface control points). Exact for straight-edged faces.
//! The app stores that value into `pivot` the moment the face selection is
//! committed (through [`face_transform_pivot`], the same computation), so the
//! rotation centre is a number in the document: re-running the history, dragging
//! the gizmo, or editing a feature upstream never moves it. A null pivot in a
//! hand-written document is resolved the same way on every run, from the same
//! input, so it cannot drift either.
//!
//! # Reference resolution and behaviour mapping
//!
//! `faces` is a `reference_selection` of FACE names — the declaration Push Face
//! and Delete Face use. A miss is an `unresolved` entry, never a panic. Every
//! `transform` component and every `pivot` component may be a number or an
//! expression.
//!
//! SOFT no-op (an empty result, no error) for an empty selection, names that all
//! fail to resolve, faces spanning multiple solids, and the IDENTITY motion — a
//! half-filled dialog must not shout. A kernel `Err` → `ctx.fail` (halt): the
//! refusal names the offending entity, and neither primitive mutates its input,
//! so the source solid is untouched.
//!
//! # Name preservation and the exit
//!
//! Both roads are pure geometry edits: no face, edge or vertex is created or
//! destroyed, so every id and name survives. Names are COLLECTED, never
//! re-stamped, and the result reuses the TARGET solid's name. The result goes
//! through [`crate::accept_sound`] once, at the exit, as Move Face and Rotate
//! Face each did.
//!
//! The acceptance is the one step that can change topology, and only on a
//! BREAKOUT — a motion that carries the selection clean out of the faces it
//! opened through, which both primitives build as a body passing through
//! itself. Its crossing repair then splits the pair along their carriers' exact
//! section, drops what ended up on the wrong side and RE-TRIMS the neighbour
//! that is left holding an unanswered boundary, so edges and vertices move
//! while every FACE name still survives. It says so in the result's `notes`
//! rather than changing the answer silently.
