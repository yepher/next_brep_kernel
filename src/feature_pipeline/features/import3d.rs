//! IMPORT3D — Import 3D Model (STEP). Ported from the retired `Import3dModelFeature`.
//!
//! Three headless sources, tried in order:
//! 0. **`inputParams.nativeBrep`** — a native [`crate::snapshot_solids`] payload
//!    (`io/snapshot.rs`): the exact solids of an earlier import, already carrying
//!    their final IMPORT3D names. Tried FIRST and EXCLUSIVE — a feature carrying
//!    it must not also carry `stepText`/`igesText` (an error, not a precedence
//!    puzzle). The solids register VERBATIM under their stored names: re-deriving
//!    them would break every scene-metadata record and every constraint keyed to a
//!    face name. This is the lane a STEP-assembly part document rides on (see
//!    `docs/developer/kernel-plans/step-assembly-import.md` §3.2), and the reason
//!    the snapshot container is a DURABLE format, not a cache (§6 there, and the
//!    `io/snapshot.rs` module doc).
//! 1. **`inputParams.stepText`** — the raw ISO-10303-21 document, baked in by the
//!    toolbar Import lane ([`crate`]'s host: `EngineState::import_step_feature`).
//!    Runs the exact Rust STEP importer
//!    ([`crate::import_step_with_appearance`] — the colour-carrying form).
//! 2. **`persistentData.importCache`** (`kind == "step-brep"`) — SUPERSEDED by
//!    `nativeBrep`. The JS-era persisted EXACT BREP records of a previous import
//!    (`serializeBrepSolid` was the serde `BrepSolid` JSON, so records deserialize
//!    directly) — verbose and unversioned. NOTHING in the Rust tree writes it; the
//!    reader stays only so a JS-era saved model still opens. New payloads go in
//!    `nativeBrep`.
//!
//! Name fidelity (contract rule 2, byte-matching `Import3dModelFeature`):
//! - Body names (`importedSolidNames`): a single body keeps the feature name;
//!   several get `{feature}_SOLID_{N}` with N 1-based, zero-padded to
//!   `max(2, digits(count))`.
//! - Faces (`importedBodyFaceNames` / the single-body fallback): a MULTI-body
//!   import names EVERY face `{bodyName}_Face_{f}` positionally (shell/face
//!   order) so faces stay unique across bodies; a SINGLE body prepends the
//!   (unique) feature name — `{feature}_{stepName}`, or `{feature}_Face_{f}` where
//!   the STEP file left the face unnamed — so two separate imports never share a
//!   face name (the cross-solid name-uniqueness guard's collision class). Edge
//!   names re-derive from the face names, so the derived edges are namespaced too.
//!
//! COLOUR rides the same names. What a STEP file's presentation entities assign
//! (`io/step_import/styles.rs`) is stamped here as a `{"color": "#RRGGBB"}`
//! scene-metadata record on the FINAL body/face names — see `io/appearance.rs`
//! for the convention, [`stamp_appearance`] for the write, and
//! [`native_import_payload_with_appearance`] for the lane that seals it into a
//! part payload. The stamp is a NON-overwriting merge, so a colour edited in the
//! caller's info panel survives a history replay.
//!
//! ONE convention, ONE implementation: [`stamp_imported_names`] holds it, and
//! every lane that names imported bodies goes through it — the live import lanes
//! (via [`add_named_bodies`]) and the payload encoder [`native_import_payload`].
//! Names are stamped ONCE, at import, and then frozen in the payload; a later
//! change here does NOT retro-rename already-imported parts, which is the point
//! (a constraint keyed to a face name survives reload).
//!
//! The failed-import base64 retry lane (`persistentData.failedImportFile`) is
//! not yet migrated — it errors loudly rather than silently skipping.
