//! TU — Tube. A BALL-AND-STICK pipe network: exactly ONE solid segment per input
//! edge, joined by a SPHERE at every junction (a vertex where ≥2 segments meet).
//!
//! # Model (the spec)
//!
//! - Each selected edge → its OWN segment body, following that edge exactly
//!   (start vertex → end vertex, radius = tube radius): a CYLINDER for a straight
//!   edge, a swept circle for a curved one (see "Curved edges" below).
//! - Edges are grouped into CONNECTED COMPONENTS by shared endpoints. Each
//!   component becomes ONE solid; DISCONNECTED components become SEPARATE solids
//!   (selecting several disconnected paths just yields several tubes).
//! - At every junction node (degree ≥ 2, i.e. where two or more segments meet —
//!   a simple corner, a 3-way/4-way branch, anything) a SPHERE is unioned in,
//!   filling and rounding the joint. This is what makes 3-way junctions work: the
//!   sphere bridges arbitrarily many arms. Its radius is the tube radius at a
//!   STRAIGHT-THROUGH node with cylindrical arms and a CLEARANCE factor × the
//!   tube radius wherever two arms form a crotch or either arm is curved. That
//!   factor is not fixed: [`assemble_component`] walks
//!   [`JOINT_CLEARANCE_LADDER`] smallest first and keeps the first rung the
//!   EXACT boolean builds. Rung 0 is 1.0 — an INSCRIBED ball, exactly the tube
//!   radius, standing proud of nothing — and it is what a crotch normally gets
//!   now; the wider rungs survive as fallbacks for a model that still refuses.
//!   See "Joint booleans" below for why the bead was ever there.
//! - Free ends (degree 1) keep the segment's flat cap.
//!
//! # Bends (`bendRadius > 0`)
//!
//! A corner where exactly TWO STRAIGHT edges meet can be ROUNDED instead of
//! filled: the path is pulled back from the node by `bendRadius / tan(γ/2)` on
//! each side, a tangent arc is laid across the corner, and the whole run of
//! segments joined by such corners is swept as ONE body — no joint ball, no
//! boolean, no bead, and a wall that is tangent-continuous through the turn.
//! This is the only construction here with NO clearance in it, because a bend
//! has no crotch: the tangency the ladder's wider rungs exist to bury is a
//! property of two equal-radius arms meeting at a point, and a bend never lets
//! them meet.
//!
//! The lane is chosen PER NODE. A branch (degree ≥ 3) has no single corner to
//! round and keeps its ball; a curved arm arrives with its own tangent and the
//! arc that would meet it is a different solve, so it keeps its ball too. Both
//! coexist with bends in one path.
//!
//! A bend is built from EXACT pieces and SEWN, not lofted: an extruded cylinder
//! per straight run, a revolved torus sector per corner, interior caps dropped,
//! and the coincident rims paired by [`crate::sew_solid`]. The pieces meet
//! tangentially — that is what G1 means — and a tangential contact is the class
//! the imprint declines, so they cannot be UNIONED; but they do not need
//! intersecting, because they already abut. Measured on a 90° elbow: −2.0e-11
//! against `π·r²·L`, every carrier analytic. The lofted chain sweep remains as
//! the fallback for a run the sew cannot close, and reads −5.7e-6.
//!
//! What a bend COSTS is face count: two half-faces per piece, because
//! `revolve_profile_brep_named` will not take a single closed profile curve and
//! the legs must match its rims edge for edge or nothing pairs. A chain of ONE
//! segment with no corner is still dispatched back to the cylinder lane, so a
//! tube that never asked for a bend keeps its single-face walls.
//!
//! Hollow bends bore CONCENTRICALLY — outer and inner sweep the same path — so
//! the wall through a turn is the same thickness as along the straight, which
//! the ball lane cannot do (its two assemblies use clearance balls of different
//! radii, so a joint's wall varies).
//!
//! # Joint booleans (robustness)
//!
//! Two equal-radius arms leaving a node in different directions are TANGENT to
//! each other at the crotch — the two points `node ± radius·(â×b̂)/|â×b̂|`, at
//! distance exactly `radius` from the node. A joint ball of exactly `radius`
//! leaves those tangent points ON its own surface, so the arm-vs-arm face pair
//! stays a SINGULAR (tangent-node) intersection whatever order the bodies are
//! unioned in: sphere-first buries the arms' MIDDLES, not their crotch.
//!
//! That contact is an ISOLATED NODE — two transverse branches crossing at a
//! single point — and the imprint ASSEMBLES it:
//! `csg/imprint/tangent_contact.rs` separates an isolated node from an
//! EXTENDED contact by the rank of `II_a − II_b`, the 2D arrangement carves the
//! pinch on both faces, and the union is exact. An inscribed ball is therefore
//! the normal answer, and rung 0 of the ladder is 1.0.
//!
//! It was not always. The imprint used to refuse every tangential contact
//! alike, the SoS perturbation lane rescued the union by shifting an operand
//! bodily, and that is where the joint's microns-off geometry and its shredded
//! end-cap crescents came from (reported 2026-09-09). The clearance existed to
//! dodge that refusal: a ball a hair wider trims each arm back past its own
//! crotch, so every pair the boolean sees is a clean transversal crossing. Once
//! the refusal was narrowed to extended contacts, the aspect dependence the
//! ladder had been calibrated against turned out to be the GATE rather than the
//! geometry — an inscribed ball builds at every aspect measured from 5 to 200.
//! The wider rungs are still tried in order, accepting only an exact build.
//! A straight-through node of cylindrical arms has no crotch and keeps
//! the plain `radius` ball, which is invisible inside the run.
//!
//! The unions are assembled in a CONNECTIVITY order (each body overlaps the
//! running solid) so the boolean is never asked to union two DISJOINT bodies
//! (untested multi-shell assembly). BINARY folds only.
//!
//! # Where the joint ball's seam runs
//!
//! A sphere is ONE face with a pole-to-pole seam edge and a degenerate edge at
//! each pole — the only way a closed sphere fits a rectangular parametric
//! domain — and the union keeps whichever of them land in the region that
//! survives. A surviving seam borders the SAME face on both sides: a line drawn
//! across the joint that bounds nothing, plus a stray vertex at the pole
//! (reported 2026-09-09). The ball is the kernel's own scaffolding, so
//! [`joint_ball_frame`] chooses a parametrization that parks the seam and both
//! poles INSIDE the arms that are about to remove them, and the joint face comes
//! out bounded by its rim arcs alone. Nothing downstream reads a joint's `u = 0`.
//!
//! # Hollow (`innerRadius > 0`)
//!
//! Build the whole assembly TWICE — once at the outer radius, once at the inner —
//! and subtract the inner solid from the outer, per component. For a STRAIGHT
//! tube the outer and inner are exact and share coincident end caps, so the
//! bore opens cleanly. Curved segments share concentric sweep frames and end caps.
//!
//! Junctions use the same ball-and-stick construction at both radii, keeping
//! the bore connected through corners and branches. The radii specify the arm
//! cross sections; joint walls follow the rounded unions rather than a constant
//! thickness offset. Each crotch ball is widened by the same clearance factor at
//! its respective radius, also at tangent joins involving curved arms: outer and
//! inner clear the SAME rung, so a joint's wall stays `k·(radius − innerRadius)`
//! and the slenderer inner assembly is usually the one that sets the rung.
//!
//! # Curved edges
//!
//! An ARC / SPLINE / HELIX edge builds its segment by SWEEPING a circle of the
//! tube radius along the edge — `sweep_profile_along_path`, the very builder
//! Path Sweep (SWP) drives, at its own 32-station default — instead of the
//! straight lane's cylinder. Nothing else about the model changes: a curved
//! segment is still ONE body per edge, still meets its neighbours at a joint
//! sphere, and still caps flat at a free end.
//!
//! The two lanes agree at their joints because the swept profile is a CIRCLE:
//! the sweep places it perpendicular to the path tangent and it is rotationally
//! symmetric, so a segment's end cap is the disc of radius `radius` centred on
//! the edge's end vertex, exactly the disc the cylinder lane caps with. Straight
//! and curved segments therefore mix freely in one path.
//!
//! Each edge is classified by SAMPLING it against its own chord (16 stations,
//! `1e-6` relative) rather than by a midpoint alone: a symmetric S-spline has
//! its midpoint ON the chord, and the two lanes emit different face counts, so a
//! misread would be a silent topology change rather than a near miss.
//!
//! FOLD-OVER is refused. A tube of radius `r` swept along a curve whose
//! curvature radius drops to `r` turns itself inside out — the sweep builder
//! documents that as the caller's problem, so the check lives here: the segment
//! curvature is sampled and a radius that reaches it is a loud error, naming the
//! two numbers (`sweep_profile_helix` refuses its own coils the same way).
//!
//! # Curved + hollow
//!
//! A hollow CURVED segment bores exactly, for the same reason the straight one
//! does: outer and inner sweep the same path through the same
//! rotation-minimizing frame at the same stations, so the bore is concentric and
//! the end caps are coincident annuli, including in assemblies with junctions.

///
/// A ball a hair WIDER buries the crotch: the union trims each arm back to

/// faces at all and every pair the boolean sees is a clean transversal crossing.
///
/// # Why a LADDER and not a number
///
/// The bead is `(k−1)·radius`, so a smaller `k` is a smaller bead — but the
/// clearance a joint NEEDS is not a constant of the shape class. It rises with
/// the arms' SLENDERNESS: the intersection features live at the scale of the
/// radius while the carrier's parameter domain spans the whole segment, so a
/// long thin arm resolves the same crossing more coarsely. Measured on a closed
/// square loop (four 90° corners, every arm junction-to-junction at both ends),
/// `BREP_NO_PERTURB=1` so only an exact build counts:
///
/// | radius | side | aspect | smallest k that builds exactly |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | 4 | 20 | 5 | ≤ 1.0005 |
/// | 2 | 20 | 10 | ≤ 1.0005 |
/// | 1 | 10 | 10 | ≤ 1.0005 |

/// | 1 | 100 | 100 | **1.02** |
/// | 1 | 200 | 200 | **1.1** |
///
/// So the 1% this used to spend everywhere was BOTH too much and too little: a
/// compact joint builds exactly at 0.05%, twenty times smaller, while an `r = 1`
/// loop on 100mm sides does not build exactly at 1% at all — it was reaching the
/// perturbation rescue, which is where the reported cap shards come from (that
/// row reads a spurious 17th vertex on a shape with 16).
///
/// The rungs bracket the measured floors with one step of margin each. The last

/// shape that no rung builds exactly still behaves exactly as it did before.
///
/// The 90° elbow is exact against its closed form —

/// the rescue's answer is `500.415251910` against the exact `500.365738317`,
/// **+9.9e-5 relative**, which is the perturbed geometry rather than the shape.
///
/// # `1.0` is the first rung, and usually the one taken
///
/// The table above was measured against the imprint's tangent-node refusal, and
/// that refusal was a FALSE POSITIVE for this class: the arm-vs-arm crotch is an
/// isolated Morse node the imprint can already carve, and the gate fired merely
/// because a clipped run's ENDPOINT sits on the trim rim with near-parallel
/// normals. With that fixed (`csg/imprint/tangent_contact.rs`), a ball of
/// EXACTLY the tube radius builds at every aspect from 5 to 200 — every corner
/// of the closed-loop series takes the first rung, `validate()` clean, genus 1.
/// **So the whole aspect dependence in that table was the gate, and a tube's
/// joint now carries no bead at all wherever k = 1 builds.** The higher rungs
/// stay as the fallback for anything that still refuses.
///
/// The one number that held this back, and where it went: those k = 1 loops read
/// 1.2e-6 BELOW the closed form `4πr²s − 16r³/3 + 4πr³/3`, five times this

/// | joint lune `2r²·(π/2)` | 12.566370614 | 12.566310213 | **−4.81e-6** |
///
/// The arm walls — the bulk of the solid — are right to 1e-7; every joint lune
/// is low by the same −4.81e-6, and the SAME deficit appears on an open path's
/// joint, which reads exact overall. The loop's total inherits it because a

/// `kernel-tube-joint-seam-2026-09-09.md` measured on this very face (−2.31e-6
/// before the seam frame, +4.10e-7 after) — a documented property of integrating
/// a trimmed spherical patch, not something k = 1 introduced.
///
/// The shape itself is sound where it matters: `solid_connectivity` reports one
/// shell, one component, no pinch vertices, and `solid_self_intersections`
/// returns **flagged = false with 0 confirmed out of 13,636 candidate pairs**.
