//! Sheet-metal flange and the shared core used by hems. Each selected rim
//! receives a bend and child flat; evaluation replaces the body under its name.
//! Picks may name side faces, hole segments, or their rim edges, all on one body.
//!
//! The straight leg is `flangeLength - refSetback`: inner-virtual-sharp uses
//! `R*tan(|angle|/2)`, outer-virtual-sharp (default) uses `(R+t)*tan(|angle|/2)`,
//! and tangent-to-bend uses zero. Tangent-to-bend requires at least 90°.
//! Hems force tangent-to-bend and 180°. Zero bend radius inherits the tree
//! default for flanges, or uses `1e-4` for hems because zero cannot revolve.
//! `useOppositeCenterline` mirrors the fold through the sheet plane.
//!
//! The fold line shifts inward by `insetShift - offset`, where material-inside
//! uses `t+R`, material-outside uses `R`, and bend-outside uses zero. Circular
//! hole radii grow by this shift. Edge setbacks restrict the bend to
//! `[start, length-end]`; circular-hole setbacks are unsupported.
//! Straight hole segments form flaps; full circles form revolved collars.
//!
//! Relief cuts are holes in the parent flat: rectangular, obround, or a
//! triangular tear notch. Relief defaults to none; default width is thickness
//! and default depth past the fold line is the neutral-fiber bend allowance.
//!
//! Adjacent picks in one feature trim at intersecting inset lines. Open corners
//! remove the overlapping corner square. Closed corners extend the earlier
//! wall by `R+t` and the other by `R`; miter corners cut both at 45°.
//! Closed/miter treatments require perpendicular corners and 90° folds.
//! Acute/reflex corners, over-folds, and reshaping an edge already flanged by
//! another feature are rejected. Finite-width rip slots use SM.CUTOUT.
