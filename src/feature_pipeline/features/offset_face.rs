//! O.F — Offset Face. A CONSTRUCTION feature: the record contract is EMPTY.
//!
//! This feature builds three `SKETCH` groups (the offset face sheet + its boundary
//! edges/vertices, named `${featureId}:${label}` / `...:PROFILE`) and returns
//! `{ added: [SKETCH groups], removed: [] }`. It NEVER adds or removes a SOLID —
//! the source solid is untouched (the browser volume expectations pin exactly
//! this: `test_offsetFace_preserves_individual_edges` expects the single record
//! `P.CU1` at its unmodified 125 mm³).
//!
//! In the cutover pipeline a `FeatureResult.added` entry becomes a caller SOLID record
//! (`PartHistory.#runHistoryImpl` wraps every added handle via
//! `Solid.fromKernelHandle`), so carrying the offset sheet as an `AddedSolid`
//! would fabricate a solid the established convention never had. Hence: resolve the
//! references (contract rule 1 — a name miss is `unresolved`, never a halt), add
//! nothing, remove nothing. The SKETCH display group itself is a display-side
//! artifact (like datum/plane/sketch visuals) built by the display lane, not
//! by the geometry pipeline; the kernel's curved-correct carrier op
//! ([`crate::offset_face_carrier`]) stays reachable through the one-shot wasm API
//! the retired builder called (`resolveOffsetFaceCarrier` →
//! `tryCreateRustOffsetFaceCarrier`).
//!
//! Param fidelity:
//! - `inputParams.faces` — a `reference_selection` (FACE names), `multiple`.
//!   Empty → no-op (`{ added: [], removed: [] }`).
//! - `inputParams.distance` — must be FINITE (zero accepted, unlike O.S / THK);
//!   non-finite → no-op. The value itself is consumed by the caller's display builder.
