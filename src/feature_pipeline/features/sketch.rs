//! S / SKETCH — the profile-producing construction feature.
//!
//! The 2D constraint
//! SOLVER already lives in Rust (`solvers/sketch_solver.rs`); what was missing —
//! and what this feature adds — is turning a solved sketch into an extractable
//! 3D PROFILE the add-material features (extrude/revolve/loft/sweep/rib +
//! sheet-metal tab/contour-flange) consume by name.
//!
//! Pipeline:
//!   1. Read the raw sketch (`persistentData.sketch` = `{points, geometries,
//!      constraints}`) and the plane `basis` (`persistentData.basis`). The basis
//!      is computed SCENE-SIDE (from object
//!      transforms / face normals) and marshaled in — directive §1 keeps the
//!      reference/plane resolution scene-side; Rust just consumes the frame.
//!   2. Pre-evaluate expression-string coordinates/values against the shared
//!      pipeline `Env` (a point `x`/`y` or a constraint `value`/`valueExpr` may be
//!      `"width/2"`) — the solver only understands numbers. An expression that
//!      does NOT resolve FAILS the sketch: the solver's `coerce_coord` reads a
//!      surviving string by its leading numeric PREFIX (`"20*Hh"` → `20`), which
//!      silently built a watertight solid of the wrong size.
//!   3. `solve_sketch` → solved point coordinates.
//!   4. Reconstruct the model geometries (skip `construction`), chain them into
//!      maximal endpoint-connected runs. CLOSED runs become profile loops
//!      (outer-vs-hole by containment); OPEN runs become the sketch PATH — the
//!      `loops` and `openChains` are built side by side,
//!      so a single sketch legally carries a closed profile PLUS a separate open
//!      sweep trajectory, and neither invalidates the other.
//!   5. Emit each loop as `NurbsCurve`s placed in the plane frame; store the
//!      `SketchProfile` in the scene under the sketch's id (contract: no solid,
//!      like a construction pass-through, but carrying a profile).
//!
//! Geometry point semantics are the ground truth from the edge builder:
//! `line = [p0, p1]`; `arc = [center, start, end]`
//! sweeping CCW start→end (the pipeline normalizes the sweep into `[0, 2π)`); `circle =
//! [center, radiusPoint]` (a closed loop by itself); `ellipse = [center,
//! majorAxisEnd, minorAxisEnd]` (the affine image of the unit circle, a closed
//! loop by itself); `bezier = [p0, c1, c2, p1, …]`
//! (`3n+1` control points, chained cubic spans) rebuilds as one clamped degree-3
//! B-spline (see [`SegKind::Bezier`] / [`bezier_chain_curve`]). Any OTHER geometry
//! type errors loudly (no-fallback); the sketcher's freehand/curve tool emits
//! `bezier` (the standalone 3D spline is a separate feature, not a sketch
//! geometry).
