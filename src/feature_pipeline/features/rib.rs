//! RIB — Rib. Backed by the Rust `rib_from_profile`.
//!
//! # What this feature does
//!
//! It reproduces SolidWorks' RIB: an OPEN sketch chain is thickened into a thin
//! wall and grown until it LANDS ON THE PART, then unioned in — so the result
//! REPLACES the target (`removed: [target]`).
//!
//! # Headless contract (post-cutover)
//!
//! Both scene inputs resolve BY NAME, no marshaled geometry:
//! - `profile` names a SKETCH whose ordered OPEN chain the SKETCH feature already
//!   published as a path (`scene.resolve_path`, via `common::resolve_path`) — an
//!   ordered `Vec<NurbsCurve>` of the profile's line segments. A single resident
//!   EDGE also resolves (its curve); a lone edge publishes no plane, so a STRAIGHT
//!   one has no rib plane to work in and errors clearly.
//! - `targetSolid` names the resident solid to fuse into (`scene.resolve_solid`).
//!   A miss is a structured `unresolved` entry (contract rule 1), NOT a halt.
//!
//! # Extrusion direction — SolidWorks' two, and they are not interchangeable
//!
//! `extrusionDirection` is SolidWorks' control of the same name, and it decides
//! WHICH AXIS CARRIES WHICH:
//! - `PARALLEL_TO_SKETCH` (the default, and SolidWorks' own): the material grows
//!   PARALLEL to the sketch plane, thickness applied NORMAL to it. A line drawn
//!   between two walls becomes a thin fin standing ON its sketch plane — the rib
//!   or gusset everybody means.
//! - `NORMAL_TO_SKETCH`: the material grows NORMAL to the plane, thickness applied
//!   IN it. The chain is thickened inside its own plane and that ribbon is driven
//!   off the plane.
//!
//! Getting these the wrong way round does not tilt a rib slightly — it lays down
//! the fin that should stand up, which is what this feature did before.
//!
//! # The profile plane
//!
//! Both directions need the profile's PLANE. When the profile is a SKETCH that is
//! the plane it was AUTHORED on, published as a named frame under the sketch id
//! (`common::sketch_plane_frame`) — the same frame `SM.CF` and the hole feature
//! take. Only a FRAMELESS profile (a resident solid edge) falls back to deriving
//! it from the chain's bends, which is sign-ambiguous and undefined for a chain
//! with no bend. Taking the sketch's own plane is what makes a SINGLE-SEGMENT
//! sketch a legal rib profile.
//!
//! # Which side the material goes
//!
//! `direction` is SolidWorks' "flip material side" for the axis the extrusion
//! direction chose: `NORMAL` = `+axis`, `-NORMAL` = `-axis`, and `AUTO` picks the
//! side the part is on. For a parallel rib AUTO MARCHES from points along the
//! chain and takes the side that meets material — not a centroid test, which
//! happily aims a rib out of a shelled box's open face.
//!
//! # Up To Next — there is no depth
//!
//! SolidWorks' rib has exactly one end condition and no depth field: the rib grows
//! until it meets the next faces, and the feature FAILS when any part of it meets
//! nothing. `rib_from_profile` reproduces that by cutting an over-long sweep with
//! the part itself, so the rib's far end IS the part's faces, whatever shape they
//! are. A `depth` in a saved document is ignored.
//!
//! # V1 limitation (replicated): OPEN STRAIGHT-POLYLINE profiles only
//!
//! Arcs/curves and closed loops are rejected. Here: a
//! non-degree-1 (arc) profile curve errors clearly; `rib_from_profile` itself
//! rejects a closed chain, and a collinear chain with no plane to fall back on.
//!
//! # Name fidelity (contract rule 2)
//!
//! The feature does NOT re-stamp faces — it lets the kernel-fused face names
//! (target faces + rib-slab faces, propagated through the union) stand. It is a
//! MODIFY, not a create: the fused solid is registered under the TARGET's own
//! name and the target is consumed, so the scene sees the same body with a rib on
//! it rather than a new body named after the feature. That is the same
//! removed-then-added-under-one-name shape chamfer, fillet, hole and the boolean
//! fold all use. The source sketch is consumed too, by default
//! (`consumeProfileSketch`).
