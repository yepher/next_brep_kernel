//! DF — Delete Face.
//!
//! Removes one or more transition faces (a chamfer, a constant-radius fillet, or
//! any simple 4-sided transition face) and heals the hole by extending and
//! re-intersecting the immediate neighbours (Golovanov §6.12). A selection that
//! is a PATCH rather than a set of strips — every face of a pocket, a boss, or
//! a through bore's wall — is healed the other way, by capping: those faces
//! have no neighbours to re-intersect, so the patch and the hole loops it was
//! sunk through are dropped and the feature is un-cut.
//! Underlying kernel fn: [`crate::delete_faces_and_heal`] takes the WHOLE
//! selection and returns a fresh solid guaranteed to `validate()` — it picks
//! the cap lane or the one-at-a-time chain from the selection's own shape, so
//! this feature hands it every resolved id at once rather than chaining here.
//! A selection that is BOTH — four counterbored holes and the block's corner
//! fillets, say — is split there into its edge-connected pieces and each piece
//! takes its own lane, which is another reason the whole selection has to
//! arrive in one call.
//!
//! Reference resolution (contract rule 1): `faces` is a `reference_selection` of
//! FACE names — each resolves against the live scene-map to `(handle, face_id)`.
//! A miss is an `unresolved` entry (the caller repairs + re-dispatches), never a panic.
//!
//! Behaviour mapping — a SOFT
//! no-op (a warn, `{ added: [], removed: [] }`) for an empty selection or
//! faces spanning multiple solids, and only THROWS when the kernel heal itself
//! fails. Matched here: multi-solid / empty selection → an empty result (no
//! error, loop continues); a `delete_faces_and_heal` `Err` → `ctx.fail` (halt).
//!
//! Name fidelity (contract rule 2): the result
//! reuses the TARGET solid's name (`result.name = targetSolid.name`) and the
//! target goes in `removed`; the healed solid keeps every OTHER face's name (only
//! the deleted face's name disappears). Names are collected, never
//! re-stamped — `delete_faces_and_heal` preserves the survivors' ids and names.
