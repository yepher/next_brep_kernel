//! SW — Sweep.
//!
//! # What this feature is
//!
//! The `Sweep` feature is NOT the dedicated swept-surface op — that is `SWP`
//! (`path_sweep.rs`), which drives the profile along a curve on a
//! rotation-minimizing frame. `SW` is the TRANSLATIONAL sweep: the profile keeps
//! its orientation and slides along the path, which for a polyline path is
//! exactly one oblique prism per path segment, unioned.
//!
//! # The path: a whole SKETCH, or several individually picked EDGES
//!
//! `path` is a `multiple` `["SKETCH","EDGE"]` selection, resolved by
//! `common::resolve_path_chain`:
//!   - a whole SKETCH resolves to its published chain — its longest open run, or a
//!     lone closed loop, which `translate` refuses and `pathAlign` sweeps as a
//!     capless ring (see below) — so one selection covers the entire trajectory. `SKETCH` is a real pick lane
//!     (`SelectionFilter::sketch`), so clicking the sketch's sheet in the 3D view
//!     picks the whole sketch while clicking one of its drawn segments picks that
//!     edge;
//!   - individual sketch segments (`{sketchId}:G{gid}`) and resident solid EDGES
//!     resolve one curve each, and several of them CHAIN by endpoint coincidence.
//! The FIRST pick seeds the chain in its own drawn direction and every other
//! selection is ordered and reversed to join it, so which of the rest you clicked
//! first is irrelevant — but the first one still decides which WAY the sweep runs,
//! exactly as a single picked edge always has. (A whole-sketch pick is seeded by
//! the sketch's own published chain order.) A selection that does not form ONE
//! connected run names the stragglers and fails.
//!
//! # The build: one PORTION per path segment
//!
//! Portion `i` extrudes a COPY of the profile — translated by the sum of the
//! preceding segments' CHORDS, so consecutive portions share a cap exactly even
//! when individually picked edges meet only within tolerance — along segment `i`'s
//! chord. Portion 0 is un-translated, so a single-segment path builds the very
//! same geometry this feature always did (its faces are named per segment now —
//! see below — with the old spelling kept as their container). The union of the portions IS the exact
//! translational sweep of the profile along the polyline (the swept volume of a
//! rigid body along a polyline is the union of its per-segment sweeps), holes
//! included: each portion subtracts its own hole prisms BEFORE the union, which
//! is what carries a hole channel around a corner.
//!
//! Every segment must be STRAIGHT (degree-1, two control points), must not run
//! (nearly) inside the profile plane (the builder refuses a direction within ~6°
//! of it — `|n̂·d̂| < 0.1`), and must ADVANCE THROUGH THE PROFILE THE SAME WAY as the first — the
//! profile does not rotate, so a segment that reverses relative to it drives the
//! profile back through material already swept. Every refusal names the
//! offending segment.
//!
//! A CLOSED path is refused under `translate` BY ITS CLOSURE, not by the segment
//! that happens to reverse: the path classification
//! (`common::resolve_sweep_path`) says the run is a ring, and the refusal points
//! at `pathAlign`, which builds one. Going round a loop without rotating the
//! profile cannot work — the advances must sum to zero — so this is a real
//! boundary between the modes rather than a missing port.
//!
//! That one rule is also what makes the cap naming exact: with all segments
//! advancing the same way, portion `i` occupies `[s_i, s_{i+1}]` through the
//! profile, so its far cap and portion `i+1`'s near cap are coincident and
//! ANTI-parallel and annihilate in the union. Only the chain's own two ends
//! survive, and they survive as themselves.
//!
//! # Headless profile + path contract
//!
//! Both inputs resolve FROM THE SCENE by name, HEADLESS (the `extrude.rs` /
//! `revolve.rs` template):
//!   - `profile` names a SKETCH whose profile the SKETCH feature already extracted
//!     (`SceneMap::resolve_profile`), OR a resident solid FACE — resolved via
//!     `scene.resolve_face` → `face_profile::face_profile` (the extrude.rs /
//!     revolve.rs two-step; `from_face` switches the cap base to the FACE name
//!     and skips sketch consumption). Sweep reads
//!     each region's OUTER loop curves + carried `{sketchId}:G{gid}` edge names —
//!     no marshaled curves, no caller round-trip. Region holes subtract as the same
//!     over-long through prisms extrude uses (`common::subtract_region_holes`);
//!     region solids union into ONE result.
//!   - `path` names the trajectory, as described above.
//!
//! # Name fidelity — a face per (path segment × profile edge)
//!
//! `extrude_profile_brep` emits faces UNNAMED, in order `[side faces (INPUT curve
//! order), bottom cap (= profile base / START), top cap (= far end / END)]`. Each
//! portion stamps that order:
//!   - side `i`  → `${tag}${edgeName[i]}:${segment}_SW` (the carried
//!                 `{sketchId}:G{gid}` profile edge name, else `EDGE_${i}`, joined
//!                 to the PATH SEGMENT's own name), with the un-keyed
//!                 `${tag}${edgeName[i]}_SW` registered as the CONTAINER standing
//!                 for that profile edge's wall along every segment. So a
//!                 single-segment sweep's reference still resolves exactly, and a
//!                 reference into a multi-segment sweep names both the profile edge
//!                 and the path segment it belongs to — neither moves when the
//!                 OTHER end of the path is edited.
//!   - START cap → `${tag}${faceName}:L{loopId}_START` (portion 0)
//!   - END cap   → `${tag}${faceName}:L{loopId}_END`   (the last portion)
//!     (one pair PER REGION, keyed by the region's outer loop's stable identity —
//!     see the sketch feature's `loop_ids`; the un-keyed `..._START/_END` is
//!     registered as the CONTAINER standing for all of them. A profile with no
//!     loop identity behind it — a FACE profile — keeps the un-keyed spelling.)
//!     Interior caps are keyed by segment too (`common::CapNames::interior`); the
//!     fold-back rule above guarantees they annihilate, so they never reach the
//!     result — the keyed spelling is what they would carry if one ever did.
//!   - hole walls → `${id}:HOLE:{loop key}:${segment}`, with `${id}:HOLE:{loop key}`
//!     as their container — the same per-segment treatment as the sidewalls.
//!   - a RING (a closed path under `pathAlign`) has NO caps, so it names none and
//!     registers neither cap name nor cap container: a container standing for a
//!     face that does not exist is a name a later feature can select and nothing
//!     can resolve. Its walls take the same un-keyed container spelling every
//!     `pathAlign` wall does.
//! where `tag` = `""` for an empty id, else `${id}:`,
//! and `faceName` is the sketch profile face name `{sketchId}:PROFILE`.
//!
//! The portion union PINS `_SW` and `:HOLE:` faces out of the coplanar merge
//! (`common::union_solids_keeping`). Without it, two portions' coplanar walls —
//! guaranteed for collinear segments, common either side of a turn — fuse into one
//! face carrying one of the two names, and WHICH one depends on the boolean's
//! internal face order. Pinning is what makes the per-segment names mean something
//! stable; the cost is a seam edge where two coplanar portions meet.
//!
//! The pin covers THIS feature's own unions (portions, then regions). The user's
//! `boolean` runs through `finalize_solid_grouped` un-pinned, like every other
//! feature's, so folding a multi-segment sweep into a target can still merge
//! portion walls that end up coplanar with each other or with the target.
//!
//! # The two orientation modes, and which path belongs to which
//!
//! | the path is | mode | what it builds |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | cornered (straight segments meeting at an angle) | `translate` | one oblique prism per segment, unioned; the corner is handled; per-SEGMENT wall names |
//! | cornered, and the profile must FOLLOW it | `pathAlign` | one MITRE per joint: the section swept along each segment, both sweeps trimmed to the joint's bisector plane and sharing ONE face loop there — inner side folded, outer side extended, no bulkhead; per-SEGMENT wall names |
//! | smooth — curved, or segments meeting tangentially | `pathAlign` | ONE tube: the profile is CARRIED by the path's own rigid motion, keeping the position and angle it was drawn at; per-PROFILE-EDGE wall names |
//! | smooth AND CLOSED, and PLANAR | `pathAlign` | ONE RING: the same carry, all the way round and back to the section it started as — no end caps, `V − E + F = 0` |
//! | cornered AND CLOSED, and PLANAR | `pathAlign` | a picture FRAME: `n` mitres for `n` segments, the closing joint mitred like the rest, and NO caps — `V − E + F = 0`; per-SEGMENT wall names |
//! | cornered at a CURVED segment | neither | unbuilt (no single direction for a bisector plane to bisect, and no lane that mixes mitring with skinning); refused by name |
//! | smooth AND CLOSED, and SPATIAL | `pathAlign` | ONE RING, closed by a COUNTER-TWIST: carried once round, the section comes back rolled by the path's HOLONOMY (the solid angle its tangent indicatrix encloses, mod 2π), and minus that angle is laid down linearly in arc length so the ring meets itself (`sweep_closure` reports both) |
//! | cornered AND CLOSED, and SPATIAL | `pathAlign` | a FRAME closed the same way: the counter-twist is shared over the sides by length, each share rolled over the middle half of its side as an exact twisted wall, so the mitres stay exact and there is still one wall per (segment × profile edge); a loop whose holonomy is zero (a mirror-symmetric one) is a plain frame |
//!
//! The gate between the two LANES of `pathAlign` is the JOINT ANGLE, not
//! curvature: a joint inside the tangent-break band is skinned as one tube, and
//! one past it is a corner — mitred when both its segments are straight,
//! refused when either is curved. `translate` refuses a CURVED segment for the
//! mirror reason — a chord does not follow a curve. So the two modes now differ
//! on a cornered polyline only in WHERE the section sits: `translate` slides it
//! without rotating, `pathAlign` turns it through each joint.
//!
//! # What `pathAlign` means, exactly
//!
//! The section at path parameter `t` is the profile moved by THE SAME RIGID MOTION
//! THE PATH UNDERGOES between its start and `t`:
//!
//! ```text
//!     section(t) = P(t) + R(t) · (x − P(0))
//! ```
//!
//! `R(t)` is the rotation carrying the path's start tangent frame to its frame at
//! `t` (`SectionPlacement::Rigid` in the builder). So the profile's POSITION
//! relative to the path and its ANGLE to the path are the drawn ones, and the only
//! thing that changes along the sweep is what the path itself does. Two readings
//! fall out, and they are the reason the mode exists:
//!   - a STRAIGHT path has `R ≡ I`, so the profile translates along the segment's
//!     vector for the segment's length — the oblique prism `translate` builds from
//!     the same inputs, exactly, not merely to within the station sampling. The
//!     modes agree on a straight path rather than merely agreeing in volume;
//!   - a circular ARC has `R` = the rotation about the ARC'S OWN CENTRE AXIS, so
//!     the profile is carried round that pivot and the end cap keeps the angle to
//!     the tangent the start cap had. A full circle is exactly a revolve;
//!   - a HELIX has `R` = the SCREW about its own axis, so the profile keeps its
//!     place relative to the coil's axis and a whole number of turns lands the end
//!     cap on the start cap lifted by the height. The helix's axis comes WITH the
//!     path — the HX feature publishes it beside its edge, and
//!     `common::resolve_sweep_path` carries it onto `SweepPath::screw_axes` — and
//!     without it a helical curve is framed like any other curve, by the
//!     rotation-minimizing frame, which rolls away from the screw by the helix's
//!     integrated torsion. That roll was the hosted-app report of 2026-09-15 ("Sweep
//!     seems to rotate the profile in an unexpected way as it follows the path").
//! The START cap therefore lies in the sketch plane. The path need not start on
//! the profile, or touch it: an offset profile sweeps the ring its offset traces.
//!
//! This is NOT what `SWP` (path_sweep.rs) does with the same builder: `SWP`
//! TRANSPLANTS the profile onto the path (centroid on the path, plane square to
//! it), discarding both the offset and the angle. The two features build the same
//! solid only for a profile drawn centred on and square to the path start.
//!
//! NAMING, `pathAlign`: one tube means exactly one wall per profile edge, so a
//! wall takes the un-keyed CONTAINER spelling `{tag}{profileEdge}_SW` rather than
//! the per-segment `{tag}{profileEdge}:{segment}_SW`. Nothing positional is in
//! either: both key on the carried `{sketchId}:G{gid}` name. Because `translate`
//! already registers that un-keyed string as the container standing for that
//! edge's walls across every segment, a reference stored under it resolves under
//! BOTH modes — flipping `orientationMode` does not break a downstream reference.
//! Caps keep the loop-keyed spelling, and one portion has no interior caps.
//!
//! # Deferred paths (clear errors, never a silent geometry drop)
//!
//! - UNDER `translate`, a CURVED path segment — the loft-through-transformed-copies
//!   branch — is not yet migrated; the error names the segment and points at
//!   `pathAlign`. What is deferred is that LANE, not the path: `pathAlign` sweeps a
//!   curved path TODAY, as one tube, and skips the straight-segment loop below
//!   outright (`filter(|_| !path_align)`), so the refusal is never reached in that
//!   mode.
//! - a path that DOUBLES BACK through the profile, under `translate` — sweep the
//!   run one direction at a time. A CLOSED path is the special case of it that
//!   `pathAlign` builds instead (see the mode table), and its refusal says so.
//! - `orientationMode: "pathAlign"` on a cornered path with a CURVED segment.
//!   An all-straight cornered polyline is MITRED (see the mode table); a corner
//!   at a curve is not, and the reason is the mitre's own construction — it trims
//!   both sweeps to the plane that BISECTS their directions, and a curve has no
//!   single direction to bisect. Refused by name, saying which segment is curved.
//! - a CLOSED cornered polyline which CROSSES ITSELF: it would build a frame that
//!   passes through itself, and the refusal names the two sides. A SPATIAL one is
//!   built (see the mode table), and refused only where its counter-twist has no
//!   room: a side whose mitres reach into the middle half its share rolls over,
//!   or a section reaching so far from the path that the roll would tilt a wall
//!   past the 0.1 transversality floor. Both quote their measurement.
//! - a mitre with no ROOM for it: a bend too TIGHT for the section across it (the
//!   inner fold would reach past the far end of a segment, so the bisector plane
//!   cuts the section a second time and the inner side self-intersects), and a
//!   COLLAPSED bend at or past the 168.522° fold angle. Both quote the measured
//!   quantity — the surviving wall length against the segment's own, or the angle
//!   against the bar.
//! - a non-zero twist on a cornered path: a twist is laid down over the sampled
//!   stations, a mitre has none, and rolling the section between two exact pieces
//!   would pull apart the shared loop that IS the construction.
//! - a non-zero `twistAngle` (a no-op upstream, but a geometry-shaped param we refuse to
//!   silently ignore) is not yet migrated.
