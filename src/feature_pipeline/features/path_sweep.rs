//! SWP — Path Sweep. Rewired to resolve its profile + path FROM THE SCENE by name
//! (the headless cutover), mirroring `extrude.rs` / `revolve.rs`.
//!
//! # What this feature is (audit finding)
//!
//! The DEDICATED swept-surface op — NOT the `Sweep` (SW) feature, which only
//! extrudes along a chord and ignores twist. This feature sweeps a closed
//! planar profile along a path via `sweep_profile_along_chain`, which folds the
//! twisted and anchored single-curve builders behind one call and sweeps a
//! MULTI-segment path as one continuous tube. This port honors twist exactly
//! the same way.
//!
//! # SWP or SW — which sweep a path belongs to
//!
//! The two features now accept the SAME path selection (a whole sketch, or
//! connected edges chained head-to-tail), and they divide on the path's SHAPE
//! rather than on how it was picked:
//!   - **SWP (here)** drives the profile along the path on a
//!     rotation-minimizing frame, so the profile turns to follow a curve. A
//!     TANGENT-CONTINUOUS run is skinned between sampled stations as one tube.
//!   - **SW** translates the profile along each segment's chord and unions the
//!     portions, so the profile never rotates — and it refuses a CURVED segment.
//! A CORNER is no longer the line between them. An OPEN path of STRAIGHT
//! segments meeting at corners is MITRED here: the section is swept along each
//! segment and both sweeps are trimmed to the joint's bisector plane, where they
//! share one face loop — inner side folded, outer side extended, no bulkhead
//! between them, a picture-frame corner. SW's `pathAlign` mode mitres the same
//! path the same way (the construction is the shared builder's); the two still
//! differ in WHERE they put the section, which is this feature's whole point:
//! SWP transplants it onto the path, SW's `pathAlign` carries it from where it
//! was drawn.
//! A CLOSED cornered path is the whole FRAME: its closing joint is mitred like
//! every other, and the result has no caps at all (see below — a frame and a ring
//! are the same capless shape reached by the two lanes).
//! What is still refused, by name: a corner at a CURVED segment (a curve has no
//! single direction for a bisector plane to bisect, and no lane mixes mitring
//! with skinning), a closed cornered loop that CROSSES ITSELF, a SPATIAL frame
//! whose counter-twist has no room (below), a bend too TIGHT for
//! the section across it — on a frame, the two mitres of one side OVERLAPPING —
//! and a COLLAPSED bend at or past the 168.522° fold angle.
//!
//! # A CLOSED path is a RING — or, cornered, a FRAME
//!
//! A path whose last segment ends where its first begins — classified as such
//! when it is resolved (`common::resolve_sweep_path`) — sweeps as one CAPLESS
//! ring: the stations go round the loop with the first and last the same station,
//! and the sections skin through the CLOSED loft, so the result is one face per
//! profile edge, no caps, `V − E + F = 0` and genus 1. A CORNERED closed path is
//! the same capless topology reached by the MITRE lane instead — `n` walls per
//! profile edge for `n` segments, one shared loop per joint, still no caps and
//! still genus 1 — which is why the cap names are dropped on `path.closed`
//! rather than on the lane. The volume is Pappus — the
//! section's area times the distance its centroid travels, which under
//! `Transplant` IS the path length, since the centroid rides the path.
//!
//! A PLANAR loop's frame turns only about the plane normal, so it returns to
//! itself and the section meets itself at the seam. A SPATIAL loop's frame
//! returns ROLLED by the path's holonomy — the solid angle its tangent
//! indicatrix encloses, modulo 2π — and the builder closes it with the smallest
//! counter-twist: laid down linearly in arc length on a ring, shared over the
//! sides by length on a frame (each share rolled over the middle half of its
//! side, so the mitres stay exact). `sweep_closure` reports the holonomy and the
//! twist applied. A frame is refused, by name, where that roll has no room.
//!
//! A requested `twistAngle` on a closed path rides on that counter-twist, over the
//! whole lap, so after one lap the section comes back turned by exactly the
//! requested angle. It builds only when that turn carries the section onto itself:
//! a whole number of turns, or a step of the section's own rotational symmetry
//! about the path (90° for a centred square), read curve for curve as drawn.
//! Anything else is refused by name by the builder
//! ([`crate::SWEEP_TWIST_CLOSURE_REFUSAL`]), quoting the nearest twists that close.
//! Each loop is swept in a call of its own, so a HOLE loop is asked the same
//! question about the same path axis: an off-centre hole closes only on whole
//! turns, and a hole sharing the outer loop's symmetry closes on its steps. Under
//! a fractional turn each wall lands on the next profile edge's curve after the lap
//! and is still one face, named for the edge it leaves from.
//!
//! # Headless input contract (post-cutover)
//!
//! Both inputs resolve from the live scene, by name (no marshaled curves):
//! - `profile` `reference_selection` names a SKETCH whose profile the SKETCH
//!   feature already extracted (`SceneMap::resolve_profile`). Each region's
//!   OUTER loop `.curves` are a swept ring; its `.edge_names` stamp the sidewall
//!   names. Hole loops sweep along the SAME path (same twist, anchored to the
//!   FIRST region outer's placement) into cutters subtracted via
//!   `common::subtract_region_holes`; further regions sweep anchored too and the
//!   region solids union into ONE result. A profile that resolves to a resident
//!   solid FACE becomes a `SketchProfile` via `face_profile::face_profile` —
//!   the extrude.rs / revolve.rs / sweep.rs two-step, and the reason the
//!   `profile` field's filter is `["SKETCH","FACE"]`. A face profile has no
//!   sketch behind it, so nothing is consumed and the source solid stays
//!   resident.
//! - `path` `reference_selection` (`multiple`) resolves via
//!   `common::resolve_path_chain` — SW's resolver — to an ordered, head-to-tail
//!   run of named world curves: a whole SKETCH contributes its published chain,
//!   individual sketch segments and resident solid EDGES resolve one curve each
//!   and chain by endpoint coincidence, and an edge running the "wrong" way is
//!   reversed. The FIRST pick seeds the direction. The whole run sweeps as ONE
//!   tube under a SINGLE rotation-minimizing frame, so the frame carries across
//!   a joint rather than restarting per segment; a one-segment run delegates to
//!   the single-curve builders and is byte-identical to what it always emitted.
//!
//! # Name fidelity (contract rule 2)
//!
//! Side faces in INPUT-curve order, then bottom cap = START, top cap = END (the
//! loft order `sweep_profile_along_path` produces):
//!   - side `i`  → `${edgeName}_SWP`  (missing name → the `"EDGE"` fallback)
//!   - START cap → `${featureID}_START`
//!   - END cap   → `${featureID}_END`
//! There is NO `${id}:` feature tag here (unlike SW) — the
//! names are bare. Solid name `featureID || "PathSweep"`.
//!
//! A RING has no caps, so its faces are the side walls and NOTHING else — the cap
//! names are not merely unused, they are not registered, because a container
//! standing for a face that does not exist is a name a later feature can select
//! and nothing can resolve.
//!
//! The optional `boolean` param folds via `common::finalize_solid`; the referenced
//! sketch is consumed (`common::consume_sketch`).
