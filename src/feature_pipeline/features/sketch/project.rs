/// name is a resident model edge — NAMESPACED COMPONENT edges included — whose
/// curve is orthographically projected onto the sketch plane and published as
/// a read-only reference PATH under `{sketchId}:REF:{edge name}`.
///
/// - Resolution is LIVE against the scene each run, so the projection follows
///   a component re-pose exactly like the plane attach (no baked geometry);
///   the reference name in `inputParams` also makes the cache's consumed-set
///   walk re-dirty this sketch whenever the source edge's producer re-runs.
/// - The published names are `{id}:`-prefixed, so the consumed-sketch purge in
///   `SceneMap::apply` removes them with the sketch; and their FIRST segment
///   is the sketch id, so they are never component-owned — downstream
///   consumers of the projected path are correctly unfenced (derived sketch
///   geometry, not component geometry).
/// - A miss is an `unresolved` entry (contract rule 1), never an error.
