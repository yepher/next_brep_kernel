//! Stable per-LOOP identity for a sketch's closed loops.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! A profile-swept feature (extrude/sweep/revolve/loft/path-sweep) builds one
//! prism per profile REGION and stamps names on the result. Sidewalls are safe:
//! they are named from the source geometry's persistent `{sketchId}:G{gid}`. The
//! CAPS were not — every region stamped the SAME `{cap_base}_START/_END`, so the
//! post-union `ensure_unique_face_names` pass disambiguated them POSITIONALLY
//! (`X[0]`, `X[1]`, …) in shell/face encounter order. Editing the sketch to add
//! or remove a loop shifted those indices, and a fillet that referenced `X[1]`
//! silently jumped to a different island on replay.
//!
//! The fix is to give every loop an identity of its own that the cap names embed.
//! That identity must survive editing the loop itself, so it is PERSISTED: each
//! sketch geometry carries a `loopId` in `persistentData.sketch`, written back by
//! the editor on commit (`assign_sketch_loop_ids`).
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! For each assembled closed loop:
//! - if ANY member edge carries a stored `loopId`, the loop claims the LOWEST of
//!   them ("lowest number wins") and that value is written back onto every other
//!   member edge, so the loop keeps its identity as edges come and go;
//! - otherwise the loop is new and SEEDS its id from the lowest geometry id
//!   among its edges.
//!
//! Both halves are computed the same way whether or not the document has ever
//! been committed, so a sketch that has never been through the editor derives
//! exactly the id it would have been assigned — reading and writing never
//! disagree, and no document renames faces merely by being opened.
//!
//! # Resilience
//!
//! - ADDING an edge to a loop: the new edge carries no id and inherits the
//!   loop's — unchanged. (Minting also hands out ids above the current maximum,
//!   so a seed can only move down, never up.)
//! - REMOVING a non-anchor edge: the id lives on the survivors — unchanged.
//! - REMOVING the anchor edge (the one the id was seeded from): still unchanged,
//!   because the id was persisted onto the whole loop, not recomputed from the
//!   anchor. This is the case a derive-only scheme cannot handle, and the reason
//!   the id is stored at all.
//! - Editing a DIFFERENT loop: never observed here — a loop's claim reads only
//!   its own edges. That is the reported bug, fixed.
//!
//! # Collisions
//!
//! Two loops can claim the same id: a loop that SPLIT in two (both halves carry
//! the same stored id), or — because the editor mints `max(existing gid) + 1` and
//! therefore REUSES the ids of deleted geometry — a freshly drawn loop whose
//! seed collides with an older loop's stored id. Ties break in this order:
//! 1. a loop that INHERITED the id (stored on its edges) beats one that merely
//!    seeded it from a gid, so a new loop can never steal a live loop's identity;
//! 2. between two inheritors (the split case), the one holding the lower minimum
//!    gid keeps it — deterministic, and independent of loop order.
//! The loser re-seeds from its own lowest gid, or, if that is taken too, from one
//! above the highest id in play. A split therefore keeps the original id on one
//! half and mints a fresh one for the other; if the halves are later rejoined,
//! the survivor's id wins again.
