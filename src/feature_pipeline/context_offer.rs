//! Selection-context applicability — kernel-owned show/no-show for the app's
//! selection context bar.
//!
//! Each feature module exposes `context_applicable(&SelectionProbe) -> bool`
//! next to its `schema()`: the ONE per-feature answer to "does the current
//! selection make creating me meaningful?". This module only AGGREGATES those
//! functions (the `schema.rs` pattern) into [`FEATURE_APPLICABILITY`], keyed by
//! the catalogue `type` string, and the assembly-constraint equivalents live as
//! `applicable` on each [`super::assembly::constraints::ConstraintTypeDef`].
//!
//! The probe is a KIND-LEVEL summary — per-kind counts plus a few app-derived
//! roll-up booleans (`all_component`, `all_sheet_metal`) that answer ownership
//! questions the raw names would; never the names themselves. Predicates decide
//! eligibility; the app still derives WHICH reference fields to pre-fill from
//! the schema `selectionFilter`s. A feature whose references a selection can
//! never satisfy (primitives, datum-driven splines) simply returns `false`.

/// Kind-level summary of the user's current selection, handed to each
/// feature's / constraint's `context_applicable` test.
///
/// `solids` counts REAL solids only — committed sketches present in the scene
/// as solids, but their reference kind is `SKETCH`, so the app partitions them
/// into `sketches` before probing (the context bar's established split).
