//! Center (`CNTR`) — hold one component's element(s) centred between two
//! parallel planar faces of another (spec §4; the "width" mate of other CAD
//! systems). The WIDTH is two parallel planar faces on one component; the TAB
//! is one element, or two like elements, on a second component. The tab's
//! CENTRE geometry — the element itself, or the mid-geometry of the pair
//! (mid-plane of two parallel planes, mid-line of two parallel lines, midpoint
//! of two points) — is held on the width's MID-PLANE:
//!
//! | tab centre | mates | DOF removed |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | plane | `coincident_plane_plane` (mid-plane ↔ tab plane, captured facing, `reverse` flips) | 3 |
//! | line (cylindrical/conical face, straight edge) | `perpendicular` (line ⊥ mid-plane normal) + `coincident_point_plane` | 2 |
//! | point (vertex, circular edge / sphere centre) | `coincident_point_plane` | 1 |
//!
//! The element list is ONE flat `elements` array of THREE refs (two faces to
//! one element) or FOUR (two faces to two elements); the count is the mode.
//! The ROLES are inferred from the selection, never from its pick order: the
//! elements group by owning component (exactly two groups), the group that is
//! two parallel planar faces is the width, the other group is the tab. When
//! both groups qualify (two planes to two planes — a symmetric pairing) the
//! group holding the lexicographically first ref is the width, so the
//! measure's sign and the facing cache are stable under reorders.
//!
//! Every mid-geometry takes its direction from the pair's lexicographically
//! first ref (its "lead") for the same reason: [`effective_align`] keys the
//! `preferredOppose` cache on the ORDER-INDEPENDENT pair signature, so the
//! direction it captured must not flip when the user reorders the picks.
//!
//! A width split across two components (centring C between a face of A and a
//! face of B) is NOT supported: a mate plane lives in one body's frame, and no
//! solver atom expresses "equidistant from two moving planes". It is refused
//! with `unsupported-selection` naming the shape that is accepted.
