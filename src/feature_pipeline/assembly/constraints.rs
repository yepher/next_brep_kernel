//! The ten assembly-constraint definitions (build-spec §4) — ONE MODULE PER
//! CONSTRAINT, the feature-module pattern: each `constraints/<type>.rs` owns
//! everything about its type — its [`ConstraintTypeDef`] row (names, element
//! count range, duplicate family, the `applicable` selection-context predicate), its
//! schema entry, and (for the mate-mapped types) its `map` function. This root
//! only AGGREGATES them in the spec §4 table order (`feature_pipeline/schema.rs`
//! pattern) and serves the catalogue, which joins the kernel schema export
//! under its own namespace (`feature_schemas_json` → `assemblyConstraints`) so
//! the app dialog engine renders constraint dialogs exactly like feature
//! dialogs. `fixed` has no `map` — grounding is handled by [`super::lifecycle`]
//! before body building.
