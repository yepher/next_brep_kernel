//! The per-document PARTS LIBRARY — assemblies build-spec §2.1 / §10 item 3.
//!
//! Each unique part is stored ONCE per document: `{ sourceKey, sourceSignature,
//! document (the embedded full sub-part history JSON), snapshot (the io/snapshot
//! exact-BREP payload) }`, keyed by a document-unique part name. ACOMP instance
//! features (`features/assembly_component.rs`) reference entries by name and
//! carry NO payload of their own.
//!
//! # Residency and round-trip
//!
//! The library is KERNEL-RESIDENT state (thread-local, like the history cache):
//! it is seeded through [`ingest`] (the `partsLibrary` block of a history
//! request) or [`install_parts_library`] (the app → runner channel), mutated
//! through [`add_part_to_library`] / [`refresh_library_entry`], and serialized
//! for SAVE via [`parts_library_json`] — save must serialize THIS, never echo
//! the loaded block, or healed snapshots and refreshes are lost. It clears
//! with `clear_history_cache` (document-switch semantics).
//!
//! Ingest rule (stale request blocks must never undo kernel-side state): a
//! RESIDENT entry always wins — a request echoing the block the document
//! LOADED with predates any heal/refresh, so the block only FILLS names
//! missing from the store.
//!
//! # Two seeding doors, and why they differ
//!
//! [`ingest`] is fill-only because it is fed by a *possibly stale echo*. The
//! app's history runner runs OFF the caller's thread (a native thread or a
//! browser worker), so it owns a SEPARATE store that must be kept in step with
//! the app's — and re-sending the whole block on every run is what made a
//! large assembly freeze the browser UI (each run stringified megabytes of
//! payload on the main thread). The app therefore sends the library only when
//! it CHANGES, over [`install_parts_library`], which is a *replace by content
//! identity*: it may drop and replace, not merely fill. Two guards keep that
//! safe — [`parts_library_revision`] tells the sender when to re-send, and
//! [`missing_library_parts`] lets the receiver refuse a run whose parts it
//! cannot resolve (the orphan GC below can drop entries the sender still
//! believes are resident).
//!
//! # Orphan GC
//!
//! At the end of every `execute_history` run, entries whose part name is
//! referenced by NO ACOMP feature in the request are dropped — orphaned
//! payloads never accumulate in the file. (The insert flow must therefore add
//! the ACOMP feature to the history before triggering another rebuild.)
//!
//! # Isolated sub-part execution
//!
//! [`rebuild_snapshot`] executes an embedded part document HEADLESSLY to
//! (re)produce its snapshot — the [`add_part_to_library`] insert path and the
//! ACOMP self-heal lane. It deliberately does NOT recurse into
//! `execute_history`: the history cache's `retain(request_ids)` prologue would
//! free every PARENT feature's cached handles mid-run. Instead it walks the
//! sub-document's features through `execute_feature` with a local scene,
//! brackets the scene-metadata store (the sub-part's un-namespaced records must
//! never touch the parent document's), pushes the sub-document's OWN
//! `partsLibrary` as the active library (parent and child libraries are
//! independent, spec §2.2), and frees every handle it registered before
//! returning.
