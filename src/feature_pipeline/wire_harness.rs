//! Wire harness — the document's `wireHarness` block, the SIDED port graph,
//! per-connection routing, and the bundle solids. Solved at the tail of every
//! history run (like `assembly`), against the ports and spline segments the
//! run published.
//!
//! # The `wireHarness` block
//!
//! `{ connections: [{ id, name, from, to, diameter }], idCounter, buildBundles,
//! cutMargin }` on the history request, round-tripped through the saved
//! document. `from` / `to` are PORT FEATURE IDS (references are ids, never
//! labels — the panel shows the ports' `portName`s and stores their ids).
//! `idCounter` mints `wire-N` ids monotonically, like the feature counter.
//! `buildBundles` (default true) switches the bundle solids off while keeping
//! the routing. `cutMargin` (default 0, omitted at 0) is the amount the BOM adds
//! to every wire's routed length to give its cut length; the router never
//! reads it.
//!
//! # The network
//!
//! - A **port** is a PORT feature's [`PortRecord`]: a point and a unit
//!   direction. Every port has two SIDES: `A` along the direction, `B` against
//!   it. A wire that enters a port on one side must leave it on the other —
//!   that is the whole routing rule, and what makes a waypoint a pass-through
//!   rather than a junction box.
//! - A **segment** is a SPLINE feature whose first and last anchors attach to
//!   two DIFFERENT ports. The kernel builds the curve from the ports' live
//!   placements (`features/spline.rs`), so the segment's geometry is
//!   authoritative: the PHYSICAL side a segment occupies at each port is read
//!   off the curve's end tangent — `sign(t_out · dir)` at the first port,
//!   `sign(−t_in · dir)` at the last (the wire ARRIVES from the opposite
//!   half-space, so an anchor attached on side A at the end of a spline sits on
//!   the port's side B). The stored attachment side is how the spline was
//!   authored; the tangent is where the wire actually is.
//! - Segment weight = the chain's arc length.
//!
//! # The sided digraph (the retired `sided_ab_graphs` builder, kept exactly)
//!
//! Nodes are `{port}/A` and `{port}/B`. A segment joining `P/X` to `Q/Y` adds
//! two directed edges: `P/X → Q/inv(Y)` and `Q/Y → P/inv(X)`, with
//! `inv(A) = B`. Reading an edge as "leave P through X, arrive at Q on Y, and
//! you are now poised to leave Q through inv(Y)" is what encodes the pass-
//! through rule. A connection routes from `{from}/A` or `{from}/B` to `{to}/A`
//! or `{to}/B` (four Dijkstra queries, the shortest wins). A route that visits
//! the same port twice is refused and the constrained best-first search (state
//! = node + visited-port set) runs instead; if that finds nothing either the
//! connection stays unrouted with the `port-reuse` status. Endpoints must be
//! terminations (a waypoint is a pass-through, never a cable end).
//!
//! # Bundles
//!
//! Every routed connection contributes its `diameter` to each segment it
//! crosses. A segment's bundle diameter is `sqrt(Σ d² / 0.75) · 1.1` (a 75 %
//! packing efficiency and a 10 % safety factor — the established formula), and
//! its solid is a circle of that diameter swept along the spline's exact chain
//! (`sweep_profile_along_chain_with_stations`), named `WireHarness:{spline}`
//! with faces `…:Wall0`, `…:Wall1`, `…:Start`, `…:End`. The bundle solids ride
//! an extra [`FeatureResult`] (`id` [`WIRE_HARNESS_FEATURE_ID`], `type`
//! [`WIRE_HARNESS_FEATURE_TYPE`]) appended to the run's results, so the
//! display pipeline shows them through the standard solid path (rendering
//! requirement R31). A bundle that fails to build reports its error on the
//! bundle row and never halts the run.
//!
//! # Caching
//!
//! The tail caches its last outcome per thread against a fingerprint of the
//! block + the network (port records + segment chains): an unchanged harness
//! replays (`reused`, the same resident handles) instead of re-sweeping —
//! which keeps the main-thread `execute_history` replays the engine makes for
//! consumed-name / assembly sync cheap. A changed fingerprint frees the old
//! bundle handles before building; `clear_history_cache` frees them too.
