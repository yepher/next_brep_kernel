//! Imported appearance — the display colour an exchange format carries, in the
//! kernel's own terms.
//!
//! **Where colour LIVES.** The kernel has no colour field on `BrepSolid`, and it
//! does not need one: colour is scene metadata, keyed by the face/solid NAME in
//! `feature_pipeline::scene_metadata`. This module is only the CARRIER between
//! "the importer read a colour" and "the pipeline stamped it on a name" — it is
//! deliberately not a storage layer, and nothing here is serialized.
//!
//! **The record shape (THE convention, one spelling everywhere).** A colour is
//! stamped as a single string attribute on the entity's own metadata record:
//!
//! ```text
//! { "color": "#RRGGBB" }
//! ```
//!
//! * key [`COLOR_METADATA_KEY`] — `color`, US spelling, matching
//!   `BREP_render/src/color.rs` and the caller-side colour params.
//! * value — uppercase `#RRGGBB` sRGB hex, the form the info/metadata panel shows
//!   and a human can type back. [`ImportedColor::to_hex`] is the ONE producer.
//!
//! The record rides on the FINAL, stamped name, so it is captured by
//! `io/snapshot.rs` into the native IMPORT3D payload and restored with the
//! geometry — an imported colour survives save/reload and the parts library for
//! free (`docs/developer/kernel-plans/step-assembly-import.md` §3.8).
//!
//! **Precedence.** A face colour is stamped on the FACE name; a body colour on
//! the BODY name only. A body colour is never fanned out onto its faces: the
//! solid's own info window already surfaces it, and materializing it per face
//! would make the face records claim a styling the file never authored.
//!
//! **Units.** Exchange formats give components as 0..1 doubles with no gamma
//! statement; OCC, FreeCAD and every viewer that reads them treat the value as
//! sRGB and scale it straight to 8 bits, so `round(c * 255)` is the conversion —
//! no linear/sRGB transfer applied.
