//! STRUCTURED STEP export: write a product structure, not just bodies.
//!
//! The flat writer ([`super::export_step_report_named`]) puts every body of the
//! document into ONE `PRODUCT`. That is the right answer for a part, and the
//! wrong one for an assembly: a nested assembly came out as a bag of bodies at
//! their world positions, with the parts library, the instance count and the
//! hierarchy all discarded.
//!
//! This module is the other answer. It takes a [`StepAssemblyExport`] — one
//! [`StepExportProduct`] per distinct part holding that part's bodies IN ITS OWN
//! LOCAL FRAME, plus one [`StepExportOccurrence`] per placement — and writes the
//! AP242 graph the importer (`io/step_import/`) reads back:
//!
//! ```text
//!   PRODUCT -> PRODUCT_DEFINITION_FORMATION -> PRODUCT_DEFINITION
//!       -> PRODUCT_DEFINITION_SHAPE -> SHAPE_DEFINITION_REPRESENTATION
//!       -> ADVANCED_BREP_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION (the part's own bodies)
//!
//!   NEXT_ASSEMBLY_USAGE_OCCURRENCE(parent_pd, child_pd)
//!       <- PRODUCT_DEFINITION_SHAPE('NAUO PRDDFN')
//!       <- CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION
//!       -> ( REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP(child_rep, parent_rep)
//!            REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_TRANSFORMATION(
//!              ITEM_DEFINED_TRANSFORMATION(identity_axis, placement_axis) )
//!            SHAPE_REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP() )
//! ```
//!
//! # The placement convention, and why it is copied rather than chosen
//!
//! A reader composes `T = M(item_2) · M(item_1)⁻¹` to map `rep_1` into `rep_2`.
//! With `rep_1` the CHILD and `item_1` the identity axis, `T` is simply
//! `M(item_2)` — the child's frame expressed in the parent. That ordering is
//! taken from the `as1-ug-214` vendor fixture
//! (`REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP(' ',' ',#213 /* rod */,#219 /* rod_assem */)`
//! with `ITEM_DEFINED_TRANSFORMATION(' ',' ',#1041 /* identity */,#1109)`), NOT
//! from our own importer: `resolve_rep_rel_transform` reorients using the
//! child's known root representation, so a self round-trip would have passed
//! with the ordering reversed and told us nothing.
//!
//! For the same reason `item_1`/`item_2` are ITEMS of the reps they belong to —
//! the identity axis is the first item of every representation this writer
//! emits, and each occurrence's placement axis is pushed into its PARENT's item
//! list. A conformance checker requires exactly that.
//!
//! # Naming, and what PMI resolves against
//!
//! A part's bodies, faces and edges keep the part's OWN names — `Extrude1_top`,
//! not `ACOMP3:Extrude1_top` — because they are written into the part's product,
//! where the component namespace does not apply. The document still refers to
//! them by the namespaced name, so [`occurrence_paths`] walks the graph and
//! registers every entity under EVERY chained occurrence path that reaches it
//! (`ACOMP3:`, `ACOMP5:ACOMP1:`), with the vertex points moved into root space
//! so a `{body}@x,y,z` reference still matches. Two instances of one part share
//! the part's entities, so `ACOMP3:top` and `ACOMP4:top` resolve to the SAME
//! `ADVANCED_FACE`: an annotation on one instance is an annotation on the part.
