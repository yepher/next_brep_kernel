/// recovers 94% of the volume error the projection fit inherits. What is missing
/// is a way to tell that file from the ones where seating the supplied pcurve
/// makes things worse, and that question has now been asked of a whole corpus
/// rather than of one fixture: 62 STEP inputs through both lanes in two
/// populations, 56,176 offered coedges, and a round trip through our own writer
/// for every one of them, because our writer emits pcurves and is therefore the
/// largest producer of this lane's inputs. 39 of the 62 round trips are WORSE
/// under the lane and 6 are better.
///
/// Every quantity that could decide it was measured per coedge — the 3D curve's
/// distance from the carrier, the supplied trim's distance from the 3D curve,
/// each against the file's own stated precision, the trim's parameter span
/// against the surface domain, the two entity kinds, and whether the edge's two
/// supplied trims corroborate each other better than either matches the 3D
/// curve. On every one of them the benefiting coedge sits INSIDE the harmed
/// distribution, and the tightest rule that keeps it still seats a coedge of
/// `abc_00000014` that corroborates BETTER than it does (24.9x against 21.3x).
/// Zero false positives is reachable only by a conjunction whose constants are
/// that one coedge's own coordinates.
///
/// The harm is not hypothetical and is not confined to vendor files: seating a
/// fitted pcurve over an exact analytic 3D curve cost a round trip a factor of
/// 4800 in volume fidelity before the carrier test was added, and 262,000x on
/// `ttt-CAD323` with it.
///
/// What WOULD decide it is named in the record and is not this module's: our
/// writer states a precision of 1e-6 mm while verifying its pcurves only to
/// `export_knit` (at least 4e-3 mm), and the measured round-trip snap never
/// exceeds that band (3.908e-3 against 4e-3) because a pcurve that misses it is
/// omitted rather than written. A writer that stated its real band would make
/// "the trim disagrees with the 3D curve by more than the file claims" seat zero
/// round-trip coedges with no fitted constant at all — a change to `io/step`.
