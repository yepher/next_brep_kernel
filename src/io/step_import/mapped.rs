//! MAPPED_ITEM / REPRESENTATION_MAP: placing a SHARED representation.
//!
//! A `MAPPED_ITEM` is the other way a STEP file places geometry it wants to use
//! more than once. Where a `NEXT_ASSEMBLY_USAGE_OCCURRENCE` relates two PRODUCT
//! DEFINITIONS and hangs the placement off a
//! `CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION`, a mapped item sits directly in a
//! representation's item list and names a `REPRESENTATION_MAP`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   SHAPE_REPRESENTATION( ..., #item, #target, ... )   <- the USING rep
//!     #item   = MAPPED_ITEM(name, #map, #target)
//!     #map    = REPRESENTATION_MAP(#origin, #mapped)
//!     #origin = an item of #mapped   (the frame the mapped rep is authored in)
//!     #target = an item of the using rep (where that frame lands)
//! ```
//!
//! Per ISO 10303-43 the item instantiates `#mapped` under
//!
//! ```text
//!   T = M(mapping_target) . M(mapping_origin)^-1
//! ```
//!
//! so the origin's frame is undone first and the target's applied second. The
//! origin is an item of the MAPPED representation and the target an item of the
//! USING one, which is why each is read at ITS OWN representation's unit scale
//! ([`mapped_item_transform`] takes two): a mapping from an inch part into a
//! millimetre assembly is a length in inches composed with a length in
//! millimetres, and one file-global scale gets it wrong in both directions.
//!
//! # What is NOT expanded, and why it matters
//!
//! Mapped items are found by walking a structure node's own SHAPE
//! representations ([`bodies::node_representations`]), never by sweeping the
//! file for `MAPPED_ITEM` records. That is load-bearing rather than tidy: AP242
//! saved views place the whole shape into a `DRAUGHTING_MODEL` through a mapped
//! item with an identity transform — our own PMI writer does it
//! (`io/step/pmi.rs`), and the `io1-ac-214.stp` fixture carries exactly that
//! shape at `#1026` — and expanding one would instantiate the entire part a
//! second time as a phantom occurrence of an annotation view. A
//! `DRAUGHTING_MODEL` is not one of the representations
//! [`bodies::representation_args`] recognises, so the walk never reaches it.
