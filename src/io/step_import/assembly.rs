//! STRUCTURED STEP import: read the product structure and keep it.
//!
//! [`collect_step_solids`] resolves a STEP assembly graph and then throws the
//! structure away — it composes each occurrence's world transform, bakes it
//! into a copy of the part, and returns a flat `Vec<BrepSolid>`. That is the
//! right answer for "import these bodies", and it stays exactly as it is.
//!
//! This module is the other answer. It reads the SAME graph in the SAME single
//! parse and returns it: one [`StepProduct`] per structure node holding that
//! node's own bodies IN ITS OWN LOCAL FRAME, and one [`StepOccurrence`] per
//! structure EDGE — a NEXT_ASSEMBLY_USAGE_OCCURRENCE or a MAPPED_ITEM
//! (`mapped.rs`) — carrying the child→parent placement.
//! **Nothing here is transformed.** Composing the tree — and so choosing what a
//! "component" is — belongs to the caller, which maps products onto parts-library
//! entries and occurrences onto assembly-component instances.
//!
//! Two invariants make that safe:
//!
//! - **ONE parse, each body built ONCE.** The parse is shared with nothing (the
//!   caller passes the text once), and inside it every distinct [`StepBody`] is
//!   reconstructed a single time and cloned into its product, exactly as
//!   `resolve_assembly` caches per body.
//! - **The same walk.** Tree shape, visit order, transform composition and the
//!   cycle guard all come from [`walk_occurrences`], which the flat lane also
//!   uses, so the two lanes cannot drift apart. The kernel test suite asserts
//!   the strong form of this: replaying this module's output through the flat
//!   lane's own `transform_brep` call reproduces `resolve_assembly`'s solids
//!   BIT-for-bit on every single-context assembly fixture.
//!
//! **Units are resolved PER PRODUCT here** (`step-assembly-import.md` §3.6),
//! not once per file. `derive_length_scale_mm` picks one global scale out of
//! `HashMap` iteration order, which a mixed-unit assembly — each product
//! representation carrying its own `GLOBAL_UNIT_ASSIGNED_CONTEXT` — makes both
//! wrong and nondeterministic. See [`ProductScales`].
