//! 3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) import — the core specification only.
//!
//! [`read_3mf`] reads a 3MF package (an OPC ZIP container) and returns the
//! meshes its `<resources>` define plus the flattened list of instances the
//! `<build>` places, in millimetres. It is a READER: the triangle soup it
//! produces goes into the same mesh-to-solid chain STL and OBJ use
//! (`brep_reconstruction::stl_conversion::convert_stl_mesh_to_step`); no
//! geometry is built here.
//!
//! # What is supported
//!
//! The core specification (3MF Core Specification 1.x,
//! `http://schemas.microsoft.com/3dmanufacturing/core/2015/02`):
//!
//! * `<model unit>` — `micron`, `millimeter`, `centimeter`, `inch`, `foot`,
//!   `meter`, defaulting to `millimeter`; every coordinate and translation is
//!   converted to millimetres, the unit the kernel works in.
//! * `<resources>` with `<object id type>` carrying either a `<mesh>`
//!   (`<vertices><vertex x y z>`, `<triangles><triangle v1 v2 v3>`) or a
//!   `<components>` list of `<component objectid transform>`.
//! * `<build>` with `<item objectid transform>`.
//! * The 3x4 row-vector `transform` attribute on components and items, composed
//!   inner-to-outer, with the winding of a mirrored instance reversed so the
//!   soup stays outward-facing.
//!
//! # What is ignored, by design
//!
//! Everything outside the core namespace: the materials-and-properties, slice,
//! production, beam-lattice and secure-content extensions. Extension elements
//! are skipped as whole subtrees and prefixed attributes (`p:UUID`, a
//! triangle's `pid`/`p1..p3` property indices) are never read, so a file that
//! carries them imports as pure geometry rather than failing. A package that
//! declares such an extension REQUIRED (`requiredextensions`) is refused
//! instead, because honouring it is exactly what this reader cannot do.
//! `<metadata>`, thumbnails and object names carry no geometry and are skipped.
//!
//! Anything the core specification makes required and the file omits — the
//! start-part relationship, an object id, a triangle's vertex indices, a
//! component's or item's `objectid` — is refused with a [`ThreeMfError`]
//! naming the package part it was read from.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! Nothing here grows to fit its input. The container refuses encryption,
//! ZIP64, multi-disk packages and any compression but stored and deflate; a
//! part is refused before decompression when it DECLARES more than
//! [`MAX_PART_BYTES`], the deflate output stops at the declared size, and every
//! part's CRC-32 and length are verified after it. The XML reader refuses a
//! `<!DOCTYPE>` outright (so no entity is expanded, internal or external) and
//! caps nesting. The model is held to [`MAX_MESH_VERTICES`],
//! [`MAX_MESH_TRIANGLES`], [`MAX_INSTANCES`], [`MAX_TOTAL_TRIANGLES`] and
//! [`MAX_COMPONENT_DEPTH`]. Every offset in the container is computed with
//! `checked_add`, because the kernel's release profile sets
//! `overflow-checks = false`.
//!
//! # Dependency review (why the container is hand-rolled)
//!
//! `BREP_kernel` publishes to crates.io and compiles to wasm on nine declared
//! dependencies, seven of them unconditional; `zip` and `flate2` appear nowhere
//! in `BREP_kernel/Cargo.lock` (they are in `BREP_app`'s lock only, pulled in by
//! the egui/image stack, not by anything the kernel links). `zip` with
//! `default-features = false, features = ["deflate"]` still adds `flate2`,
//! `miniz_oxide`, `crc32fast`, `adler2` and their support crates to a published
//! geometry kernel. The container here is ~1000 lines of reader for a format the
//! kernel needs in one place, matching how STEP, IGES, STL and OBJ are already
//! read: [`zip`] parses the central directory, [`inflate`] implements RFC 1951,
//! [`xml`] is a bounded pull parser. Every one of them refuses rather than grows.
