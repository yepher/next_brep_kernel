//! One pcurve fitter for a curve that lies on a surface, verified out of sample.
//!
//! # Why a fit through samples of the track is not enough
//!
//! A curve lying on a surface has an image in the surface's parameter space,
//! its TRACK, and a pcurve is a cubic fitted to that track. The track is only
//! as smooth as the surface's parameterisation. A rational-quadratic
//! revolution — every sphere, cylinder and torus `make_revolution` builds —
//! carries double knots at its quarter points, where the parameterisation is
//! C1 and not C2. A smooth 3D arc crossing one of those knot lines has a track
//! whose tangent is continuous and whose second derivative JUMPS there, and a
//! single cubic through uniform samples across that jump converges as O(h²),
//! not O(h⁴). Measured 2026-09-17 on the 10-cube star fillet's corner patch:
//! uniform doubling first reaches the 1e-7 floor at 2048 samples and still
//! misses it at r = 9; broken at the crossing it reaches the floor at 129.
//! That was the whole of the patch's closure residual, 5.3e-7·r², and a
//! +1.09e-4 volume error at r = 9 that `fillet_edges` accepted.
//!
//! So the fit BREAKS at every knot-line crossing — the crossing is inserted as
//! an exact sample, the pieces either side are fitted separately, and they are
//! joined with the EXACT track tangent at the crossing prescribed on both
//! sides, so the pcurve is C1 there as the track is. Joined without it, the
//! two pieces kink by 2.1e-6 rad on the rung that reaches the floor, which an
//! offset or an imprint would read as a real corner.
//!
//! # Why the check is at midpoints
//!
//! Every rung is measured at the midpoints between the dense track samples,
//! each projected on its own. Measured at the samples a rung interpolates, the
//! miss reads zero by construction whatever lies between (the corner patch's
//! 33-sample pcurves read 1e-16 there and 1.9e-5 in uv between). The measure
//! is 3D — the pcurve pushed through the surface against the curve's own point
//! on the carrier — so it needs no period unwrap.
//!
//! The fitter REPORTS: the fit, the samples on the rung it stopped at, and the
//! measured miss. The caller decides what a miss over the floor means, and says
//! so where it decides (see [`TrackFit::on_floor`]).
