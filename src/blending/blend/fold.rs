//! Does the wall a march would build FOLD THROUGH ITSELF?
//!
//! A constant-radius blend surface is the envelope of one ball rolling along
//! its centre curve, so it is a CANAL surface, and a canal surface of radius ρ
//! folds exactly where the centre curve turns tighter than ρ — the ball's
//! characteristic circle sweeps past the centre of curvature and comes back
//! through itself. The kernel's own section says the same thing in Pappus
//! form: the volume element `(1 − κ ξ) dA ds` changes SIGN inside the section
//! when `ρ κ > 1`, and a sign change there is not a small error, it is two
//! parameters carrying one point.
//!
//! The refusal is TERMINAL, like [`super::BALL_OFF_CARRIER`], and for the same
//! reason: the shape of the answer is wrong, not the lane. Neither the exact
//! cutter nor the maximal-valid-subset search builds the trimmed envelope a
//! folded wall needs; they build the same self-intersecting surface or none.
//!
//! ## What is measured, and why it is not a chord
//!
//! Three consecutive MARCH STATIONS are useless for this: on the 2026-09-02
//! two-collar document the tightest bend is sampled with centre chords of
//! 1.500 on a curve whose radius of curvature is 1.512, and the circumradius
//! through those three stations reads 1.97 — clean, at a place that folds by
//! 32 %. The fold factor here is measured by RE-SOLVING the tangency system a
//! small step either side of the station, so the circumradius is a converged
//! finite difference of the true centre curve rather than a chord of the
//! march's own sampling.
//!
//! ## The section, not the ball
//!
//! `ρ κ > 1` alone is not the condition. The wall spans only the arc between
//! the two contacts, and the fold is at the direction the curvature vector
//! points: a valley whose crevice lies on the CONVEX side of its centre curve
//! never folds however tight the turn. So the factor maximises `ρ (k⃗ · û)`
//! over the section arc — `ρ|k⃗|` when the curvature direction is inside the
//! arc, and the larger endpoint otherwise. On a circular boss's concave rim
//! the curvature direction IS inside the arc and the factor is
//! `ρ/(R + ρ) < 1`; on a bore floor's it is outside it altogether.
