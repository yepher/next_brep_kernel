//! The stripe network: a whole selection blended as one construction.
//!
//! # Why this is not a loop over single-edge fillets
//!
//! Blending one edge at a time means every blend after the first is built
//! against a solid the previous ones have already cut, and a corner where two
//! or three of them meet has to be RECONSTRUCTED afterwards from whatever they
//! left behind.  That is the origin of both classic failures: a cutter run
//! past its edge to make a boolean assemble removes material the fillet never
//! touches, and a corner closure that has to identify leftover caps by
//! distance heuristics silently gives up and leaves the corner unmade.
//!
//! Here nothing is cut until everything is known.  Every stripe is marched
//! against the ORIGINAL solid, so the result cannot depend on selection order;
//! every corner is solved from the corner ball ([`solve_corner_ball`]) before
//! any topology changes; and each stripe is then trimmed to the station where
//! its own rolling ball IS the corner ball.  At that station the stripe's
//! contact points ARE the ball's tangency points, so:
//!
//!   * the two stripes sharing a face end their contact rails at the same
//!     point and the face's loop closes with no connector and no leftover;
//!   * at a STAR (every edge at the vertex selected) the stripe's end
//!     cross-section is an arc of the corner sphere, so it can be the shared
//!     edge with the corner patch — exactly tangent, with nothing to intersect;
//!   * at a MITER (two edges selected, the third sharp) the two blends run on
//!     past the ball and are trimmed against each other along their seam,
//!     marched as a level set from the ball's tangency point (`miter.rs`);
//!   * no boolean is involved anywhere, so no cutter can overshoot.
//!
//! Every vertex of the selection is classified once — free end, miter, or
//! star — so a selection mixing them (a face perimeter with one star corner)
//! is one construction, not a composition of per-corner special cases.
//! Configurations the lane does not construct refuse BY NAME: a smooth (G1)
//! two-edge vertex, which is a chain and not a corner; mixed-convexity
//! corners, where the convex stripe has no closure at all because it never
//! reaches the vertex — it switches CARRIERS onto the concave stripes'
//! surfaces and dies in a pole, measured in `runout.rs`; re-entrant
//! miters (the blends wrap the concave edge instead of meeting in a seam);
//! no-common-ball stars.  A CHAMFER reaches the lane too: its stripes are the
//! same march with a chord section (`cross_section_basis`), its STAR closes
//! with the facet those chords bound (`build_chamfer_corner_facet`), its FLUSH
//! join shares one chord where a fillet shares one arc, and its MITER trims the
//! two bevels against each other along a seam marched on the chamfer's OWN
//! level — the signed distance to the sibling's ruled bevel, because the
//! sibling's rolling-ball CANAL is a surface a bevel is not (`bevel_level`).
//! Only the re-entrant corner refuses by name and takes the cutter
//! composition.
