//! The RUNOUT: a convex stripe's march continued with a CONCAVE STRIPE's own
//! surface as one of its carriers.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! A convex edge that DIES on the concave edges it meets — the rib spine
//! running out into the pad ring on the floor, case
//! `inbox-20260909-fillet-rib-spine-corner` — has no corner ball at that
//! vertex: the face the convex stripe shares with a concave one is approached
//! from both sides.  What the rolling ball actually does there is not a corner
//! at all, it is a CARRIER SWITCH, and the switch happens twice.
//!
//! Take the rib's tip.  Three selected edges meet: the convex spine (roof ∩
//! side), and two concave ones (floor ∩ side, floor ∩ roof).  The floor is the
//! face the two concave stripes SHARE and the convex stripe does not touch.
//!
//!  1. The convex ball rolls on the roof and the side until it becomes tangent
//!     to the FLOOR — the third face at the corner.  That is the TRI-TANGENT
//!     STATION, and it is a ball-tangency condition on an input face, not an
//!     incidence: [`plan_runout`] solves `dist(centre, floor) = r` along the
//!     edge, which is transversal.
//!
//!     At that station the ball is automatically tangent to the floor-side
//!     stripe's own surface as well, and its contact on the SIDE sits exactly
//!     on that stripe's rail there.  Both follow from one fact: a ball of
//!     radius r tangent to both faces of a concave edge from the material side
//!     is the MIRROR, across either face, of the ball that generates that
//!     edge's radius-r fillet, so their centres are 2r apart and the two balls
//!     touch — at the contact point itself.  The tangency is therefore a
//!     GRAZE: the centre's distance to the stripe's SURFACE has a MINIMUM
//!     equal to r there rather than crossing it, a double root, which is why
//!     the station is solved on the floor and only CHECKED against the stripe.
//!
//!  2. Past it the ball rolls on the roof and on the floor-side stripe's
//!     SURFACE.  That is the runout march this module builds: the same §4.9
//!     tangency system with the stripe's fitted surface as the second carrier
//!     and the section plane still riding the convex edge (extended past its
//!     own vertex).
//!
//!  3. It stops where its contact with the kept mate ENDS — where that contact
//!     reaches the OTHER concave stripe's rail on the roof.  By the same
//!     mirror identity that is exactly where the ball grazes the second
//!     stripe, so the stop is found as the MINIMUM of the distance to it
//!     (well conditioned, unlike the double root) and reported with its
//!     residual.  Past the stop the first carrier switches too, and the ball
//!     rolls on the two STRIPES.
//!
//!  4. That last stretch ends in a POLE: the two concave stripes' rails on the
//!     face they share MEET, the ball's two contacts merge there, and the
//!     blend section shrinks to a point.  The pole is a curve-curve
//!     intersection of two rails the march already fitted, not a solve.
//!
//! # What this module is for
//!
//! It measures the class: the station, the carrier pair, the marched stretch
//! with its contact residuals, the stop and the pole.  The mixed-convexity
//! refusal (`fillet/edges.rs`) reports those numbers instead of only naming
//! the corner, so the refusal says WHICH construction is missing and where.
//! Composing it — three stretches, two flush junctions and a degenerate pole
//! per spine end — is `fillet-stripe-network.md` item 2/4 and is NOT done
//! here.
