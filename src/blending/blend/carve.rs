//! CARVE the folded lens out of a blend wall, and sew its CREASE.
//!
//! A wall whose ball-centre curve turns tighter than the ball is a canal
//! surface past its own fold (`blend/fold.rs` measures that, and refuses the
//! walls this module cannot carve).  The envelope such a march sweeps is not
//! the blend: it carries a lens of parameter that lies INSIDE the swept ball
//! volume, so the trimmed envelope — the actual boundary of the rolled ball —
//! is that envelope with the lens cut away and the cut sewn as a crease.
//!
//! # Why the cut is NOT the fold locus
//!
//! Both curves live on the same wall and they are not the same curve.  For
//! `P(s, psi) = c(s) + rho(cos psi N + sin psi B)`,
//!
//! ```text
//! P_s = (1 - rho kappa cos psi) T + tau P_psi
//! ```
//!
//! so the surface is SINGULAR on `1 - rho kappa cos psi = 0` — the cuspidal
//! edge, which is what the offset carve (`offset/fold_locus.rs`) traces for a
//! displaced surface.  Cutting there leaves two sheets that still pass THROUGH
//! each other: the sheets cross on the SELF-INTERSECTION, which lies strictly
//! outside the singular lens and meets it only at the two SWALLOWTAIL points.
//! So the carve here is at the self-intersection, the singular lens is interior
//! to what it discards, and that containment is asserted rather than assumed.
//!
//! # The three facts that make the trace deterministic
//!
//! 1. The section at `u` is a circular arc, so its CENTRE is the circumcentre
//!    of three of its points and the ball centre is available from the surface
//!    alone.
//! 2. With that centre, `g = (S_u x S_v) . (S - centre(u))` evaluates to
//!    `-rho^2 (1 - rho kappa cos psi)`, so the SIGN of one scalar is the fold
//!    locus — no reference normal, no heuristic threshold.
//! 3. The fold locus is a closed lens in `(u, v)` whose two extremal-`v` points
//!    (`g = 0` and `g_u = 0`) ARE the swallowtails, and the swallowtails are
//!    exactly the two ends of the crease.  They are therefore SOLVED, not
//!    marched to — which matters, because the two preimages merge there like a
//!    square root and a march would crawl.
//!
//! Between the ends the crease is marched in `v`, which is monotone along it
//! (the section angle runs from `+psi_max` through `0` to `-psi_max`).
//!
//! # What it refuses
//!
//! A band that reaches a RAIL or a wall boundary is not this construction's:
//! the blend does not end at a crease there, it runs out onto the neighbouring
//! face, which is the runout's territory.  Refused by name with the measured
//! margin.  So is a chamfer section (a straight section has no ball centre to
//! read), a lens whose two ends do not both solve, and a crease whose fitted
//! pcurves cannot be brought inside the caller's tolerance — each with the
//! number it saw.
