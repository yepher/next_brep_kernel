//! A planar carrier must hold its own trims.
//!
//! # The defect
//!
//! A face's surface is a FINITE chart: a plane carrier is a rectangle, sized by
//! whichever feature built the face, not an infinite plane.  Every pcurve on it
//! is built by projecting the 3D edge and then CLAMPING the projection into the
//! chart's parameter box (`pcurve.rs`, the `parameter[0].clamp(u0, u1)` pair —
//! an open direction has no wrap to fall back on).  So when the blend's surgery
//! gives a face a trim that runs OUTSIDE the chart it was created with, the
//! clamp silently folds that trim onto the chart's boundary: the edges are
//! right, the loop closes in 3D, and the FACE is the wrong region.
//!
//! Nothing downstream notices. `validate()` sees a watertight, incident,
//! connected body; `check_loop_self_crossings` sees a simple loop (the folded
//! trim does not cross itself); only the shell vector-area scan reads it, and
//! only as a number nobody had attached to a cause.  On the 2026-09-08 rib-base
//! document the reported fillet F8 leaves `RIB6:S5:G0_TOP` with four trims up to
//! 3.030e-1 outside its 9.7705 x 2.0000 chart, and the body it integrates reads
//! **350.388894999** against the edge-bounded **350.358599** — a 3.03e-2 error
//! that `validate()` passes, with the face's closure departure at 2.026e-1
//! against its 2.15e-6 bar (7470x) and its loop gap at 6.869e-1.
//!
//! # The repair, and why it is the carrier that moves
//!
//! Two answers were possible: stop the rail at the face's real boundary, or
//! extend the carrier to hold it.  The measurement picks the second — the trims
//! that leave the chart lie IN the plane (off-plane <= 1.3e-12 on that document)
//! and the loop they form closes on its own vertices (3D joint gaps <= 4.2e-13).
//! The rail is right and the rectangle is too small; there is nothing to fix
//! about the rail, and stopping it would move geometry that is already correct.
//!
//! So: widen the plane's rectangle — same plane, same `eu`/`ev`, same normal, so
//! the face's sense and the solid's orientation are untouched — until it
//! contains every trim of that face, then rebuild that face's pcurves on the new
//! chart.  This is exact for a plane and only for a plane: a planar chart is an
//! affine window onto a surface that continues correctly outside it, which is
//! not true of a general carrier (a B-spline's extension is an extrapolation),
//! so nothing here fires on a non-planar face.
//!
//! # What it refuses
//!
//! The repair is held to the geometry it claims, not to `validate()`:
//!
//! * an out-of-chart trim whose EDGE does not lie in the plane is a wrong body,
//!   not a chart that is too small — [`PLANAR_CHART_EDGE_OFF_PLANE`];
//! * a rebuilt trim that does not follow its own edge to the refinement floor —
//!   [`PLANAR_CHART_WIDEN_UNSOUND`].
//!
//! Both are TERMINAL in the group lane, like [`crate::blend::CONSUMED_SNAP_UNSOUND`]:
//! the cutter composition is not a second opinion on a wrong body.
