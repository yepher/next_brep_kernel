//! Full-width corners: the topology a stripe network leaves when a blend is
//! exactly as wide as a face it meets at a corner.
//!
//! # What collapses, and why it is not snapped
//!
//! At a full-width corner the corner ball touches its faces ON their
//! boundaries: a miter whose radius is the side face's width puts the shared
//! face's tangency point on that face's far vertex, a star at full width puts
//! every tangency on a vertex, and a channel whose middle edge is exactly two
//! setbacks long puts both miters' shared-face points at one point.  Each
//! stripe's rail between two such stops has NO length (`build_open_surgery`
//! builds no edge for it), so its two rim vertices are one vertex, and the
//! faces around it lose area:
//!
//! * a face whose every boundary edge was consumed or collapsed keeps an EMPTY
//!   loop — the shared face of the miter, all three faces of the star;
//! * a face left between two coincident edges has zero area — a side face
//!   between its sewn rail and its far edge, the channel's top face between the
//!   two coincident rails, a star stripe's bevel between its corner section and
//!   its free end's section.
//!
//! Nothing here moves geometry by more than the solid's `consumed_band`
//! ([`crate::blend::consumed_band`], the sliver tolerance): the rims that are
//! identified were decided one point by that band, and edges are merged only
//! when they coincide within it.  The body is then held to its closure bar
//! ([`check_collapse_closure`]), because an identification is a trim moved
//! onto what already existed, which `validate()` cannot see.
