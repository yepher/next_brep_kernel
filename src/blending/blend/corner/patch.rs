// §6.9.7 vertex ("star") blend — convex trihedral corner.
//
// When three edges meeting at a convex vertex are filleted, the rolling
// ball tangent to all three faces sits at ONE position and its sphere is
// the vertex patch (Golovanov §6.9.7). The patch is a spherical octant:
// with the sphere centered at C = P − r·Σ mᵢ (mᵢ = outward face normals),
// its three corners are the tangent points Tᵢ = C + r·mᵢ and its three
// boundary arcs are the tangent circles sphere∩cylinderᵢ, which lie in
// the coordinate planes through C (arc T₁T₂ = sphere∩(edge-3 cylinder),
// in the plane ⟂ m₃, etc.). Built as a sub-rectangle u∈[0,¼], v∈[½,1] of
// a sphere revolution with polar axis m₃ and x-axis m₁: the three arcs
// are exact iso-parameter curves (two meridians + the equator) and the
// v=1 pole is a degenerate edge at T₃. No booleans — the tangent
// surfaces are never intersected, only constructed and sewn.

/// Build ONLY the spherical-octant `FaceRecord` (plus its degenerate pole
/// edge) for a vertex blend, reusing the three EXISTING tangent vertices
/// `t_ids` and the three FRESH tangent-circle arc edges in `arcs`
/// (`(edge_id, start_vertex, end_vertex)`).  The loop, pcurves and
/// same_sense are exactly the spherical-octant construction described above;
/// each arc coedge's
/// `forward` is derived from the stored edge orientation so the octant use
/// is opposite to the fillet use (shared edge, two coedges, opposite sense).
