//! The two-edge miter (§6.9.6): two stripes meeting at a vertex whose third
//! edge stays sharp.
//!
//! # Why this is not a surface-surface intersection call
//!
//! The seam between the two blends starts at P, the corner ball's tangency
//! point with the SHARED face — and there the two blend surfaces are tangent
//! to each other (both carry the shared face's normal).  A normal-based SSI
//! refuses P as a seed and is ill-conditioned next to it, which is the
//! blend-blend tangency drift the boolean miter has to weld over.  And two
//! equal-radius canals whose spines cross intersect in TWO branches through
//! P; only the one running toward the sharp edge is the seam.
//!
//! So the seam is marched as a level set on the FIRST stripe's own domain.
//! A constant-radius blend is the radius-r canal of its centre path, so a
//! point of stripe 1 lies on stripe 2 exactly when its distance to stripe 2's
//! centre row is r.  Step the station parameter from P toward the vertex and
//! solve the section coordinate alone: P is exact by construction, the
//! pcurve on stripe 1 is the sample list itself, the branch is chosen by the
//! direction of the march, and the gradient is fine everywhere off P.
//!
//! The seam leaves the strips through one of the two OTHER rails.  When it
//! leaves both at once the exit lies on the sharp edge and the corner is
//! symmetric.  Otherwise the stripe it left first is done, and the other one
//! is closed by a CONNECTOR — its own section by the first stripe's other
//! mate face, from the exit point down to the sharp edge — which is a
//! transversal level set (distance to that face) and marches the same way.

///
/// # What this band now decides, and what it was derived against
///
/// Its derivation above is BISECTION NOISE — "the march's own arithmetic". That
/// was the whole story while `march_connector`'s own bar was
/// `1e-11 * (1.0 + scale)`, which scaled a NORMALISED row parameter by model
/// size and left every connector sitting orders over this band on noise alone:
/// the groove rim's read 3.592e-9 against a 1.791e-11 bar, 200x over, and no
/// connector could come near collapsing. Inverting that bar (see the comment at
/// the head of `march_connector`) drops the same connector to 3.514e-12, 5.1x
/// UNDER. So this band's job changed with it: it used to separate "straight"
/// from "noisy samples", and it now separates "straight" from "genuinely curved
/// by a few times 1e-11" — a finer judgement than the number was chosen for.
///
/// Surveyed over `cargo test --test all` under `BREP_DEBUG_NETWORK` at the
/// commit that inverted that bar: 72 marched curves, 20 distinct shapes.
///
/// ```text
/// no collapse (some deviation over its bar)   59   closest 8.05e+08x OVER
/// collapses (worst deviation < bar/3)         13   closest 0.1962 of its bar
/// all three under, worst within 3x of bar      0
/// ```
///
/// About nine orders of empty parameter space between the two populations, so
/// nothing in that suite is a judgement call. That is evidence the band
/// separates cleanly in practice; it is not the reason the band is safe.
///
/// # Why a near-miss does not matter, and what actually constrains this
///
/// It is tempting to read "a curve that only just fits under the band" as the
/// dangerous case. It is not. `line_deviation` maxes over the SAMPLES at their
/// own chord-length parameters, so all-three-under says the sampled polyline
/// lies within `bar` of the chord — and replacing it with that chord therefore
/// moves nothing by more than `bar` itself, `1e-11·(1 + extent)`, about 1.1e-10
/// on a 10 mm model against the 1e-7 the kernel treats as linear. A curve at
/// 0.9 of the band and one at 0.001 of it are both discarded at a magnitude
/// nothing downstream can see, so "genuinely curved or merely noisy" has no
/// consequence here.
///
/// Which tolerance, though, decides whether that margin is constant — and the
/// 1e-7 above is the kernel's STRICTEST, not the one that adjudicates this
/// property. Against `model` alone the margin does shrink with size: 909x on a
/// 10 mm part, 10x at a metre, and exactly 1x at a ten-metre extent. But what
/// actually tests an edge's curve against its pcurve — the thing this collapse
/// changes — is `KernelTolerances::pcurve_acceptance`, which is
/// `max(pcurve_consistency, 0.025 · model diagonal)` and so scales WITH the
/// model. Both sides then grow together and the margin is AT LEAST about 2.5e9
/// at every size: 1.1e-10 against 0.25 on a 10 mm part, 1.0e-7 against 250 at
/// ten metres. There is no crossover against the comparand that matters.
///
/// At least, not exactly, and the gap is in the reader's favour: this band
/// scales with the CURVE's own chord (`extent` is `last - first` of its
/// samples) while the limit scales with the MODEL's diagonal. Those are equal
/// only for a curve spanning the whole model, which is the worst case and the
/// one these figures assume. A miter seam or connector is a blend-sized feature
/// on a part-sized model, so its extent is orders below the diagonal and the
/// real margin is larger still.
///
/// Quote the figures and the comparand, never an order count: the count hides
/// the model size, and a bare crossover hides which tolerance it crossed. Both
/// read as facts about the collapse when they are facts about a comparison. The band's JOB changed when `march_connector`'s bar was
/// inverted; its SAFETY never depended on that.
///
/// What the safety does depend on is the PAIR (band, sample count), because the
