//! TANGENT CONTACT CLASSIFICATION — is a tangency inside the trims an
//! isolated NODE, or an EXTENDED contact?
//!
//! Where two carriers touch with parallel normals, the intersection is no
//! longer a manifold curve and the marcher's step direction `n_a × n_b`
//! vanishes.  Two entirely different shapes hide behind that one symptom, and
//! the imprint's ability to handle them is entirely different:
//!
//! * **An isolated node.**  Two transverse branches CROSS at the tangency —
//!   the classic equal-radius pair, whose two sections meet at `node ±` the
//!   common perpendicular.  The section is still a curve everywhere except one
//!   point, the 2D arrangement carves the pinch on both faces, and
//!   `fragment::loops` derives the sub-edges each region needs.  The imprint
//!   ALREADY assembles this (two crossing equal-radius cylinders build exact
//!   against Steinmetz), so it must not be refused.
//!
//! * **An extended contact.**  The carriers are tangent along a whole CURVE —
//!   a sphere inscribed in its cylinder, or the G1 join where an analytic
//!   torus elbow meets its own-radius arm.  There is no section curve to
//!   imprint at all: the contact is a shared smooth EDGE the imprint has no
//!   representation for, and pushing such a pair through the marcher yields a
//!   torn shell (measured: non-integral genus one operand order, five open
//!   edges the other).  That class must be refused, and named.
//!
//! # Why this is a RANK question and not a tolerance
//!
//! Write both carriers as graphs over their common tangent plane at the
//! contact.  Their difference `g = f_a − f_b` has a critical point there, and
//! its Hessian is `H = II_a − II_b`, the difference of the two second
//! fundamental forms measured against the SAME normal.  The local structure of
//! the intersection is exactly the sign structure of `H`:
//!
//! | `H` | contact | measured |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | two eigenvalues of opposite sign | Morse saddle: two branches crossing | equal-radius cylinders `±0.5`, ratio `1.0`; equal-radius tori `±0.4635`, ratio `1.0` |
//! | rank-deficient | the contact extends along `H`'s null direction | sphere in its cylinder `(−1.1e-16, −0.5)`; G1 elbow/arm `(3.9e-33, −3.9e-33)` against a curvature scale of `0.5` |
//!
//! Those are FIFTEEN AND THIRTY orders of separation, because an extended
//! contact makes the null eigenvalue exactly zero by construction — both
//! surfaces carry the same contact curve, so they agree to second order along
//! it.  [`NODE_RANK_FLOOR`] therefore separates a rank-2 matrix from a
//! rank-deficient one; it is NOT a band, and no case sits near it.
//!
//! The separation only exists AT the contact.  At the raw witness point the
//! caller hands us — a marched sample merely within the transverse-seed
//! angular gate — the G1 elbow reads `0.039` against the torus pair's `0.695`,
//! eighteen-fold, which would be a band and would have to be tuned.  So the
//! witness is REFINED onto `{S_a = S_b, n_a × n_b = 0}` first, and only the
//! refined point is classified.  Refinement before classification is the whole
//! design.
