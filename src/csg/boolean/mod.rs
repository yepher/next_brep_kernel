// operand-specific stages to N operands:
//
//   1. Imprint EVERY unordered pair (i, j) so every mutual intersection edge is
//      present on both operands' faces, and accumulate all pairs into ONE global
//      imprint (operand indices remapped to 0..N, piece/vertex ids made globally
//      unique, per-face piece lists and per-edge split parameters merged).
//   2. Split + fragment each operand by that single global imprint, so each
//      operand's faces are cut by ALL of its intersections at once.
//   3. Select fragments in one pass: the per-fragment keep decision generalizes
//      from "vs one other solid" to "vs the SET of other solids" (see
//      `nary_keep`).  Because every pair is imprinted, a fragment's interior lies
//      wholly inside or wholly outside each other operand, so a single interior
//      test point per (fragment, other-solid) is an exact membership verdict.
//   4. Assemble with the same machinery (`assemble_fragments`), then merge and
//      validate exactly as the binary path does.
