//! # Semantic boolean oracle — an INDEPENDENT wrongness detector
//!
//! Repair-not-refuse proved the real boolean failures are STRUCTURAL: a result
//! that passes [`BrepSolid::validate`] (well-formed topology) yet is
//! geometrically WRONG — a missing face, a mis-selected fragment, an imprint
//! seam the assembler never welded.  `validate()` cannot see that; a
//! point-membership cross-check can.
//!
//! Two detectors live here, both purely diagnostic (never a hard gate in the
//! boolean hot path — see the `BREP_DEBUG_BOOL` hook in `boolean.rs`):
//!
//! * **Part 1 — semantic cross-check** ([`boolean_semantic_disagreement`]).
//!   After `A op B -> R`, sample points deterministically across the operands'
//!   combined box, classify each vs A, B, R with [`SolidClassifier`], and
//!   compare the CSG-expected membership (`UNION = in_a||in_b`,
//!   `INTERSECT = in_a&&in_b`, `SUBTRACT = in_a&&!in_b`) against R's own
//!   verdict.  Points on or near any boundary are SKIPPED (ambiguous), so a
//!   valid boolean scores ~0 disagreements and a structurally-wrong one scores
//!   a whole region's worth.
//!
//! * **Part 2 — fuse-after** ([`boolean_residual_fusables`]).  Geometry in R
//!   that is coincident within a weld band yet NOT topologically shared
//!   (distinct vertices at one point, duplicate coincident edges) — an
//!   intersector/assembler bug, because the weld should have fused it.
//!
//! Reliability is the whole point: a noisy oracle is worse than none.  The
//! On-skip band is size-coupled and deliberately conservative (a strict
//! superset of the classifier's `On` verdict via
//! [`SolidClassifier::within_band`]), and the flag threshold
//! ([`DISAGREEMENT_THRESHOLD`]) is tuned so every known-good fixture scores
//! zero.
