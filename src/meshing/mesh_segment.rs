//! Mesh face segmentation — stage 2 of the Rust mesh-import pipeline (the
//! rust-first port of the app's `buildImportSolidsFromGeometry`: deflection-
//! angle face grouping + analytic-primitive recognition; stage 1 is
//! `mesh_to_faceted_brep`).
//!
//! `segment_mesh_faces` groups the triangles of an indexed mesh (or a raw
//! STL-style soup when `indices` is empty) into smooth regions by dihedral-
//! angle region growing, then recognizes each region's analytic carrier by
//! least-squares fitting in the order plane → cylinder → cone → sphere →
//! torus.  A fit is accepted only when every region vertex sits within
//! `fit_tolerance · region-scale` of the carrier AND the triangle normals
//! agree with the carrier normal within `normal_tolerance_deg` (area-
//! trimmed: the worst slivers up to 0.1% of the region area are exempt);
//! regions with no accepted carrier stay `Freeform`.
//!
//! Tangent-smooth compounds defeat pure dihedral growing (a fillet blend
//! runs tangentially into its walls, so the walls and the blend merge into
//! one smooth region).  Mirroring the app's planar-extraction semantics, a
//! refinement pass splits such regions: seed-plane-anchored coplanar groups
//! are peeled off first (gated by `planar_extraction_angle_deg` and
//! `planar_min_area_percent`) and the leftover connected components are
//! re-fitted through the same cascade.
//!
//! `segment_mesh_faces` is geometry-only analysis: no `BrepSolid` is built
//! there.  The output — per-triangle region ids plus per-region carrier
//! records, all serde-serializable — is the input contract for stage 3,
//! `mesh_regions_to_brep`, which rebuilds a validated `BrepSolid` whose
//! faces are the segmented regions (exact planes, full revolve walls and
//! partial cylinder patches in v1) instead of one face per triangle.
