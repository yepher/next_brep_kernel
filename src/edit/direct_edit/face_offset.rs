// Push a CURVED analytic face (cylinder / cone) by OFFSETTING its carrier.
//
// The methodology (user directive 2026-08-28, the architecture principle made
// literal): a face is a TRIMMED region of an infinite carrier surface. To push
// a curved face we OFFSET its untrimmed carrier surface, then re-derive the trim
// as the INTERSECTIONS of that offset surface with the (unchanged) untrimmed
// carriers of the neighbour faces — `intersect_analytic_pair` does the surface ∩
// surface, `build_pcurve_on_surface` re-trims. This is the same engine the
// boolean imprint uses; here one surface (the pushed face's) is replaced by its
// offset and the incident edges are recut.
//
// Slice 1 scope (honest refusals, never a bad solid): the PUSHED face is a
// cylinder or cone (`RuledRevolution`); its neighbours across each boundary edge
// are PLANAR. Ruled/sphere/torus neighbours and free-form pushed faces are
// deferred.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// The exact analytic offset of a ruled-revolution CARRIER surface (cylinder or
/// cone) by `signed_distance` along its OUTWARD normal — the untrimmed surface
/// S′ whose re-intersection with the neighbour carriers gives the new trim.
///
/// A normal offset of a ruled revolution is another ruled revolution with the
/// SAME axis and half-angle: in the (axial z, radial ρ) meridian, the generatrix
/// line `ρ = rho0 + m·z` (m = dρ/dz = (rho1−rho0)/height; m = 0 for a cylinder)
/// offsets to the PARALLEL line `ρ = rho0 + m·z + δ·√(1+m²)` — a uniform radial
/// growth `grow = δ·√(1+m²)` at every z. So S′ is built by revolving the grown
/// generatrix about the SAME frame, over the SAME axial span `[0, height]` and
/// seam azimuth (`frame.x_axis`) as the source — the span keeps the neighbour
/// caps IN the surface's domain (an axis-translation offset would slide the
/// finite patch off them) and the shared seam meridian stays put.
///
/// `signed_distance > 0` grows the surface outward (radius increases). Refuses a
/// carrier whose grown radius reaches/crosses the axis at either end.
