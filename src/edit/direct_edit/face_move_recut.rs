//! Move Face by RE-CUTTING — the second road, for a motion whose answer is a
//! different topology rather than the same topology re-solved.
//!
//! # Why a second road at all
//!
//! `face_move.rs` and `face_move_carrier.rs` both MOVE A CARRIER and re-solve
//! the boundary that is already there. Where the motion leaves the body with
//! the same faces meeting the same faces, that is the whole answer, and where
//! it leaves two of them crossing, `healing/accept.rs` splits the pair along
//! their exact section and drops the overshoot. Between them they cover every
//! Transform Face the capability matrix records as building.
//!
//! They do not cover a motion whose result needs a face to STOP EXISTING.
//! The 2026-09-22 inbox document is the first report of one: a rectangular
//! through-slot cut into a block, with the slot's CEILING and one of its SIDE
//! WALLS dragged together, the ceiling carried 90 mm — clean out of the top of
//! the part. The right body is the slot re-cut as an open channel, which has
//! the ceiling gone, both side walls re-trimmed against two different outer
//! faces, and the slot's mouth loops on the two end faces merged into those
//! faces' outer loops. Measured against the boolean that cuts the same channel
//! directly: **10F 24E 16V**, where the direct edit leaves 11F.
//!
//! The pairwise crossing repair cannot reach that body, and the reason is
//! structural rather than a threshold. It splits ONE pair of crossing faces
//! along their carriers' section and drops pieces, closed over the faces the
//! imprint cut. Here the two crossings (`Box_PZ | P.CU6_NX` and `Box_PX |
//! P.CU6_PX`) BOUND EACH OTHER — the strip of the top face that has to go is
//! bounded by both sections at once — and the face that has to go whole, the
//! ceiling, is crossed by nothing at all, so no imprint ever cuts it.
//!
//! # The construction
//!
//! A planar face of a solid states a constraint on where the material is:
//! everything inside lies on one side of its carrier. Moving that face moves
//! the constraint, and the material that changes hands is the SLAB the carrier
//! sweeps, bounded sideways by the faces that bound the moved face today. So:
//!
//! 1. Each moved face must carry a PLANE. `delta = translation · n̂`, with `n̂`
//!    the face's outward normal, is how far it moves along its own normal; a
//!    face whose `delta` is zero only slides inside its own carrier and moves
//!    no material at all, so it contributes no tool.
//! 2. The TOOL for that face is the slab between the old and the new carrier,
//!    intersected with one half-space per neighbouring face — each neighbour's
//!    carrier taken at its MOVED position when the neighbour is itself in the
//!    selection, so the tools do not depend on the order they are built in —
//!    and clipped to a box around the body big enough to hold the motion.
//! 3. Which SIDE of each neighbour the tool lies on is read from a PROBE POINT
//!    rather than classified: a point inside the moved face's own trim,
//!    displaced half way along its own normal motion, lies inside the slab by
//!    construction, and the tool is on the side of every neighbour that
//!    contains it. That one rule covers a face moving INTO the body and a face
//!    moving OUT of it without a convexity branch.
//! 4. `delta < 0` — the face moving against its own outward normal — takes
//!    material away, so the tools are SUBTRACTED; `delta > 0` adds it, so they
//!    are UNIONED. A selection whose faces disagree about which is refused by
//!    name: the two tools would bound each other and the order would decide the
//!    answer.
//!
//! The tools are unioned into one before the body is cut, because two tools
//! that share a carrier — and the reported document's two share both `x` and
//! `z` planes — leave coplanar residue when they are subtracted one at a time.
//!
//! # A turn, too
//!
//! Transform Face's motion is rotate-then-translate, and a plane moved rigidly
//! is still a plane, so `recut_moved_planes_rigid` takes the whole motion: the
//! new carrier is the old one carried by it, the tool is the WEDGE between the
//! two (inside one, outside the other — the slab's own two half-spaces, no
//! longer parallel), `delta` is how far a seat inside the trim travels along
//! `n̂` to reach the new carrier, and the probe sits half way there. A turn
//! can carry ONE face into the body and out of it at once, when the line the
//! two carriers meet in crosses the face's bounds; that is refused by name
//! (`one_way_only`). A pure translation keeps this road's original arithmetic
//! to the bit. The 2026-09-22 report that needed it is the slot document with
//! its wall also turned 16.9°: see
//! `tests/suites/inbox_20260922_turned_slot_wall_transform_face.rs`.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! It is not a repair: nothing about the self-intersecting body the direct
//! edit built is read. It is the same edit performed the other way round, from
//! the ORIGINAL body and the motion, which is why it can return a body with a
//! different face count. `transform_face` reaches it only after `accept_sound`
//! has refused, so no motion that builds today changes by a bit, and a motion
//! `move_faces` / `rotate_faces` itself refuses never reaches it.
//!
//! Names are RE-STAMPED rather than collected, because the boolean mints its
//! own faces: a result face whose carrier is an original face's carrier (at its
//! moved position, for a moved face) takes that face's name, a carrier that
//! arrives as two faces takes `name_1` for the second as the breakout already
//! does, and a face whose carrier left the body keeps no name because it is no
//! longer there.
