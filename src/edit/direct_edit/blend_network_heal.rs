//! Deleting a whole BLEND NETWORK — every strip, vertex blend and mitre a
//! fillet left around a feature — as ONE question.
//!
//! Round the edges where a gusset meets a floor and a wall and the fillet
//! leaves a ring of faces around the gusset's foot: a strip along each of the
//! six edges, a spherical vertex blend where three of them meet at each corner,
//! and MITRES where a strip along the gusset's side runs into the strip along
//! its sloping top. Selecting that ring and asking for it gone is "un-round the
//! gusset", and it is the corner blend's question ([`corner_heal`]) with more
//! than one corner and with strips whose far end is not a survivor.
//!
//! One face at a time it is ill-posed for the corner lane's reason: a strip's
//! walls re-intersect in its sharp edge, and whatever the strip runs into at a
//! vertex blend or a mitre is itself about to go. The corner lane answers one
//! vertex blend and three strips whose far ends are caps. Here most ends are
//! not caps, so the set has to be read as the network it is.
//!
//! ## The construction
//!
//! Read off the network's own topology and the tangency that defines a blend:
//!
//! * a boundary edge of a selected face is a RIM when the survivor across it is
//!   TANGENT to the selected face there — that is what a blend's rim is. Every
//!   other boundary edge — a vertex blend's edges, a mitre between two strips,
//!   the edge a strip ends on at a cap face — is an END edge;
//! * a STRIP has exactly two rims, on two distinct survivors: its WALLS. A
//!   selected face with no rim at all must border only selected faces (a
//!   vertex blend enclosed by its strips), and is all end edges;
//! * a JUNCTION is a connected cluster of end edges. Everything in a junction
//!   shrinks to ONE vertex of the unblended solid — a vertex blend, a mitre and
//!   the cap edges beside it, a strip's cap on an end wall — and every strip
//!   runs between exactly two junctions.
//!
//! Then, in closed form, because every face the network touches is a PLANE:
//! each junction's vertex is where the planes of every survivor meeting at it
//! intersect, and all of them must contain it — the corner lane's "three lines
//! name one vertex" gate, for any number of planes. Each strip becomes the
//! sharp edge between its two junction vertices, which lies on both its walls
//! by that same gate.
//!
//! The topology follows the corner lane's: every network vertex collapses onto
//! its junction's vertex, every surviving edge that ended on a collapsed vertex
//! is widened along its own line, each wall swaps its rim for the sharp edge,
//! every survivor drops the end edges it wore, and every touched plane is
//! re-trimmed and its pcurves refit. The Euler characteristic is required to
//! be unchanged — un-rounding does not add or remove a handle.
//!
//! ## A strip left standing
//!
//! A selection can stop one strip short of the whole network: every blend
//! around the gusset but the one along its sloping top where it meets the wall
//! (the 2026-09-15 "delete face not working for selection" report). What is
//! asked for is then the solid with only THAT edge rounded, and it is as
//! well-posed as the whole network: the kept strip is a cylinder tangent to its
//! two walls, and the strip it mitred into is leaving, so what ends it now is
//! the CAP — the one other plane meeting that junction, the one the deleted
//! strip rounded against the kept strip's wall. The junction no longer shrinks
//! to a point. It splits into TWO vertices on the cap, where each of the kept
//! strip's straight rims runs into it, joined by the cap's section of the
//! cylinder: a circular arc when the cap is perpendicular to the axis, which is
//! the only case read. Every edge arriving at the junction ends on the vertex
//! of the kept wall it lies on; the kept strip is trimmed back to the arc and
//! refit on its own carrier.
//!
//! ## Every face bounded by blends
//!
//! Round all twelve edges of a box and select every blend: twelve strips, eight
//! spherical vertex blends, and six sides each bounded by four rims and nothing
//! else. Nothing new is asked of this lane — every junction is a vertex blend
//! and the three strips ending on it, and three planes pin its vertex — but the
//! patch gate used to claim the set first, because every survivor loop the
//! selection touches is consumed whole, and then refuse it for leaving a face
//! with no loop. It declines that shape now (`encloses_every_survivor` in
//! `delete_faces.rs`), and the set reaches this lane.
//!
//! ## Blend caps
//!
//! Round a box's four vertical edges at r = 5 and then the other eight at
//! r = 3: each r = 3 edge now runs smoothly into an r = 5 arc at both ends, and
//! the second fillet stops its strip there with a planar CAP (`plan_cap_end` in
//! `blend/network.rs`) — a triangle in the strip's section plane bounded by the
//! section arc and two straight legs, one on each wall, meeting at the strip's
//! sharp vertex, its APEX. The fillet names it `{strip}:CAP` (the feature layer
//! adds `[n]`), and that naming is what says whose material it is:
//!
//! * a cap is the END of its strip's fill. Once the strip goes there is
//!   material on both sides of it, so it goes with the strip — picked or not.
//!   The dispatch adds every selected strip's caps before any lane is asked
//!   (`with_owned_caps`), and a cap picked without its strip is refused by name.
//! * in the network a cap is all end edges (its arc on the strip, its legs
//!   across the walls), so it joins the junction its apex sits in. A cap does
//!   not share an edge with the round it ran up to — only the apex — so the
//!   network is one piece when its faces are joined through JUNCTIONS, not
//!   through edges: the two-radius body's 28 blends are twelve edge-connected
//!   pieces and one network.
//! * a junction whose cap apex is HELD — an edge outside the network still ends
//!   on it, the arc and rim of a round that stays — shrinks onto the apex: the
//!   cap's plane and the strip's two walls pin it, and the apex keeps its id.
//!   Where the round goes too, nothing holds the apex, and the corner's own
//!   planes pin the junction as they would without caps.
//! * a cap left STANDING with its own strip, beside a network that is deleted —
//!   the r = 5 rounds selected, the r = 3 strips not — keeps its apex. The
//!   junction the round's end arc shrinks to is the box corner, and each
//!   standing apex in it is joined to that corner by a SPOKE: the straight
//!   edge along the two walls the apex sits on. A plane whose loops wear
//!   neither a network edge nor a moved one — the standing cap — is not
//!   re-trimmed.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! One selection whose faces are joined through their junctions, planar
//! survivors plus kept cylindrical strips and caps, strips with exactly two rim
//! edges. A selection in several pieces, a rimless face bordering a survivor
//! that is not a cap (a pocket's wall), a rim split into several edges, or a
//! selected face tangent to one survivor or to three is not read as a network,
//! and the selection goes on to the component split and the one-at-a-time chain
//! exactly as before. One face is a network only with caps: its own, or caps
//! standing at its ends. A network that DOES read, but has a curved survivor
//! beside it that is not a kept strip of that shape (a sphere, a strip whose cap
//! is oblique to its axis) or that touches it anywhere but a fixed apex, is
//! refused by name: one face at a time has no better answer for a network. A
//! junction holding both a held and a standing apex, or a kept strip and an
//! apex, is refused by name. A single corner blend never gets here: the corner
//! lane takes it first, byte for byte as it always has.
