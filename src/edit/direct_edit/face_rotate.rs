// §6.12 sibling operation: ROTATE a face group about a picked axis.
//
// This file is what implements it, and nothing here reaches past what that
// section claims.
//
// Rotation is NOT a mode of the translation. `move_faces` moves a carrier's
// POSITION and leaves its normal alone, which is why a plane the translation is
// parallel to is invariant and why a moved rim can ride an exact affine of the
// fixed carrier. A rotation moves the normal too: the invariants are different
// (a cone about its OWN axis is invariant here and not there), the sections are
// different (plane × oblique cylinder is an ellipse, not a translated circle),
// and the corners must be solved from the ROTATED carriers rather than mapped.
// Sharing the machinery would mean an `if rotation` in every one of those
// places; the shared parts are the pure helpers this file imports.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
