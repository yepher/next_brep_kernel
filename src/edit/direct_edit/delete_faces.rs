//! Deleting a SET of faces — the multi-select half of Golovanov §6.12.
//!
//! [`delete_face_and_heal`](super::delete_face_and_heal) removes ONE face and
//! heals by re-intersecting its neighbours. That is the right heal for a
//! transition strip, and the wrong question entirely for the case the app
//! sends most often: a user has selected every face of a POCKET — its walls and
//! its floor — and wants the pocket gone.
//!
//! Such a selection is not a strip between neighbours; it is a PATCH. Its free
//! boundary is not four edges belonging to four other faces, it is one whole
//! HOLE LOOP of one surviving face — the mouth the pocket was sunk through. So
//! the heal is not to re-intersect anything, it is to CAP: drop the patch, drop
//! the hole loop, and the face the pocket was sunk into is the whole face
//! again. Nothing is refit; every surviving carrier and loop is bit-identical
//! to what it was.
//!
//! This is the same closed form [`cap_through_wall`](super::closed_heal) already
//! uses for a bore's wall, stated for an arbitrary set of faces instead of one:
//! a bore wall is simply the patch whose free boundary is TWO hole loops, in the
//! two faces the drill went in and out of. A blind pocket, a blind bore (wall +
//! floor disc), and a BOSS (a pad's wall + top, whose mouth is a hole loop in
//! the face it was grown from) are all the same operation.
//!
//! ## The lane gate
//!
//! Structural, decided before any geometry is touched:
//!
//! * a survivor loop that touches the selection is either ENTIRELY consumed by
//!   it — the ordinary case, a hole loop that goes with the patch — or CUT, and
//!   then the runs it keeps must splice back into one closed loop with the
//!   other cut loops on the same carrier.
//!
//! The second half of that is the case where the opening has no hole loop to
//! consume. A bore whose mouth is TANGENT to the boundary of the face it opens
//! through pinches that face, and the arrangement splits it in two rather than
//! hand back a loop that touches itself; the mouth then arrives as runs of two
//! faces' loops. Dropping those runs rejoins the pieces into the face they were
//! before the mouth pinched them — the same cap, stated for a free boundary
//! that cuts rather than encircles. A transition STRIP also cuts its
//! neighbours' loops and it does not splice: the runs stop at a genuine gap
//! between two different carriers, which is what re-intersection is for, so the
//! splice walk is the gate rather than a separate test (`splice_fragments`).
//!
//! The gate DECLINES one shape before it looks at a loop: a selection that
//! encloses every survivor it borders, so that no survivor would keep a loop
//! (`encloses_every_survivor`). A cap needs a face around the opening to drop
//! the opening out of, and there is none — the selection is not a pocket but,
//! say, every blend on a cube with all twelve edges rounded, whose six sides
//! are each bounded by strips alone. The lanes after this one read it; one that
//! none of them reads is refused by name rather than taken apart one face at a
//! time.
//!
//! ## The bridged rejoin
//!
//! The splice above hands one cut run over to the next AT A SHARED VERTEX,
//! which is what a pinched face's runs do. A band across a MIRRORED union does
//! not. A fillet groove that runs over the top of a part and down its side is
//! flanked, on both sides, by faces that are cosurface TWINS — the same plane,
//! the same fillet cylinder, reflected — and their runs stop at the setback and
//! tangent lines the band interrupted, a whole band's width apart.
//!
//! Those stops are not a gap between two DIFFERENT carriers, which is what
//! re-intersection is for. They are one edge with its middle taken out: at
//! such a stop the circuit doubles back on the single edge the two survivors
//! still share. So the circuit is cut at every CORNER — every handover where
//! it leaves one carrier for another — and the corners pair off: the circuit
//! leaves carrier A for carrier B at one and comes back at the other, and their
//! two spine edges are one straight line, each running away from its own
//! corner. The BRIDGE is that line's missing middle, and with it every
//! carrier's runs close into one loop again. Nothing is intersected and nothing
//! is guessed — every bridge is an edge the solid already had, continued.
//!
//! A rejoined group is the one place this lane refits. Its faces are twins
//! whose patches were fitted apart (a mirrored plane is the same plane with
//! reflected control points and a flipped `same_sense`, which bit-identity
//! reads as two carriers), so the host's carrier grows over everything it now
//! holds and every pcurve is rebuilt on it — exactly, for each carrier the
//! growth accepts. A transition strip is untouched by all of this: its four
//! corners wear four DIFFERENT carrier pairs and no two of them pair off, so it
//! goes on to the chain that re-intersects it.
//!
//! A selection that fails that test is not thereby ONE question. A user who
//! selects four counterbored holes AND the block's corner fillets has asked for
//! two different heals at once, and the whole-set gate says "not a patch" only
//! because the fillets leave part of the top face's outer loop standing. So a
//! selection the gate declines is split where it is ALREADY split — into
//! edge-connected COMPONENTS, each of which is put to the same gate on its own.
//! Patch components cap, strip components chain, and the two coexist in one
//! operation. Caps go FIRST: a cap is a pure topological drop that refits
//! nothing, so it cannot disturb a strip the chain has yet to reach, whereas a
//! chain rebuilds its neighbours' carriers and would move the loops a later cap
//! resolves its positions against.
//!
//! Once the gate says "patch", this lane OWNS the answer, refusals included —
//! the checks below name what is wrong instead of falling back to a heal that
//! was written for a different shape:
//!
//! * a consumed loop must be a HOLE in its face, not the loop that bounds the
//!   face's material. Selecting a pocket's three walls but not its floor makes
//!   the floor's OUTER loop the free boundary; capping that would leave a face
//!   with no boundary at all, so the refusal names the floor and says to select
//!   it too. A rejoined face answers the same question by AREA: it has to take
//!   in the region its free boundary encloses, not give up its own.
//! * the shell must stay CONNECTED. `validate()` deliberately does not ask
//!   (see `faces_are_connected`), and a patch whose removal severs the body is
//!   a thing this operation cannot represent.
//! * the GENUS must come out of the Euler accounting as a whole number ≥ 0.
//!   Capping a blind pocket leaves the genus alone; capping a through feature
//!   drops it by one. Neither is assumed — both fall out of the same count.
//!
//! A ONE-FACE selection is put to the same gate, and this is the one place the
//! refusals above are read as "not a cap" instead: see [`delete_one_face`]. It
//! is also why `closed_heal.rs`'s own `cap_through_wall` is now reached only
//! from inside `delete_face_and_heal` — every route through this module answers
//! a bore's wall with the general cap, which produces the same solid.
