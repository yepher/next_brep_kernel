//! Deleting a whole CORNER BLEND — a vertex blend and the strips that meet on
//! it — as ONE question.
//!
//! Round the three edges that meet at a box corner and the fillet leaves four
//! faces: three cylindrical STRIPS, one per edge, and the spherical CORNER the
//! rolling ball leaves where they run together. Selecting all four and asking
//! for them gone is "un-round this corner", and it is the commonest thing a
//! user does to a fillet after making it.
//!
//! One face at a time it cannot be answered, and the refusal was honest. A
//! strip's four neighbours are its two walls, the face it runs out into, and —
//! at the corner end — the vertex blend. The heal a strip asks for is "extend
//! the two walls, re-intersect them, and clip the recovered sharp edge against
//! both end caps"; here the recovered edge is the box's own sharp edge, and it
//! passes the corner sphere at `r·√2` — it never meets it. So
//! [`heal_open_transition_mixed`](super::open_heal) reported exactly what it
//! found:
//!
//! ```text
//! delete_face_and_heal: no re-intersection branch of the extended carriers
//! spans the deleted strip — refusing rather than emitting an invalid solid
//! ```
//!
//! No chain order fixes that. Deleting one strip out of a rounded corner is
//! not an under-solved problem, it is an ILL-POSED one: the corner sphere is
//! tangent to the strip that is leaving and to the two that are staying, and
//! what bounds it once its neighbour is gone is not a question the input
//! answers. The set is the question, and the set has a closed form.
//!
//! ## The construction
//!
//! The group is read off its own topology, never guessed:
//!
//! * the CORNER is the selected face with three boundary edges, and each of
//!   those edges is shared with another selected face;
//! * each of those three is a STRIP: a four-sided face, four distinct edges,
//!   four distinct neighbours, exactly one of them the corner. Opposite the
//!   corner edge is the strip's far CAP; flanking it are the two WALLS;
//! * the three strips' walls must be three distinct carriers, each carrying
//!   two strips. That is what makes the group a corner rather than three
//!   fillets that happen to touch: the walls close a cycle.
//!
//! Then, for each strip, exactly the single-strip heal's own closed form: the
//! two walls re-intersect in the recovered sharp edge, and the far cap clips
//! one end of it. What replaces the corner sphere is the OTHER end — the
//! recovered edge meets the third wall (the one this strip does not use) in a
//! point, and all three strips must name the SAME point. That agreement is the
//! whole gate on the geometry: three lines, each solved from a different pair
//! of planes, meeting at one vertex to within the plane tolerance. Disagree
//! and the group is refused.
//!
//! The topology that follows is the single-strip heal repeated: the corner
//! sphere's three vertices collapse onto the recovered corner vertex, each
//! strip's two far vertices collapse onto its own recovered far corner, every
//! surviving edge that ended on a collapsed vertex is widened along its own
//! line, each wall swaps its two strip rims for the two sharp edges that now
//! meet on it, each cap drops the transverse blend edge it wore, and every
//! touched carrier is re-trimmed and its pcurves refit.
//!
//! ## Nothing is left for the coalescer
//!
//! `delete_faces_and_heal` finishes every lane through
//! `merge_curve_continuation_edges`, which collapses the tangent continuation
//! edges a heal leaves behind. This lane leaves none, and that is structural
//! rather than lucky: a wall's two strip rims are REPLACED by the two recovered
//! sharp edges rather than having new pieces appended beside them, and every
//! surviving side edge is WIDENED along its own line rather than continued by a
//! second edge. So there is no continuation pair to find. Measured on both the
//! plain cube and the reported shelled document: the coalesced result is
//! bit-for-bit the counts the heal produced (6/12/8 and 14/33/21 faces / edges
//! / vertices), and a further coalesce takes 0 edges and 0 vertices.
//!
//! ## Curved walls and caps
//!
//! When a wall or a cap is a cylinder, a cone, a sphere or a torus there is no
//! closed form, and the construction is the same one with the closed forms
//! replaced ([`heal_curved_corner_blend_group`]). The corner vertex is the three
//! walls' triple point and each far corner the triple point of its strip's
//! walls and cap, solved by Newton on the INFINITE analytic carriers
//! (`triple_point.rs`, which reports iterations, residual, conditioning and a
//! first-order position bound, and refuses a corner the model tolerance cannot
//! place). Each sharp edge is the piece of its walls' intersection between the
//! two, taken from `intersect_analytic_pair` and rebuilt as the exact arc when
//! it is circular. A curved carrier is KEPT: grown exactly along its axis where
//! the recovered edges overrun its patch, and only the new and moved edges get
//! new trims.
//!
//! More than one triple point exists — two planes and a cylinder meet twice —
//! so each root is checked to be the corner the blend was cut from: it lies
//! PAST every rim of the strips it ends (measured along the wall, away from the
//! wall's own face), the corner solve returns the same point from every
//! strip's own seed, and every other root on the walls' intersection inside the
//! group's reach that is also past those rims lies farther from the seed.
//! Finally every new or moved edge must lie on every face it bounds, and on a
//! curved face's patch: relocation widens or rebuilds edges without being told
//! what they lie on, and a strip whose end touches a fourth face moves one off.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Three strips meeting on one three-sided vertex blend, whose walls close a
//! cycle of three carriers: planes in closed form, and analytic walls and caps
//! through the triple solve. Refused by name: a FITTED wall or cap (no
//! closed-form re-intersection here, though the solver itself reads a patch), a
//! wall pair `intersect_analytic_pair` has no form for, a closed intersection
//! whose piece crosses its origin and is not a circle, and a strip end that
//! touches a fourth face. A four-way star corner is not taken (its corner face
//! is four-sided); a planar star heals through the blend network lane.
