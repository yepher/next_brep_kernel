//! The point three carriers share — the corner a vertex blend was cut from.
//!
//! Un-rounding a corner asks for the vertex the blend replaced: the one point
//! lying on all three walls. Three planes answer in closed form
//! (`corner_heal.rs` intersects them directly). Once a wall is a cylinder, a
//! cone, a sphere or a torus there is no such form in general, and "one point"
//! is not even true: two planes and a cylinder meet in TWO points, a plane and
//! two cylinders in up to four. What is well-posed is the LOCAL question — the
//! triple point nearest a seed the caller took from the deleted corner's own
//! geometry — and this module answers that, with what the answer is worth.
//!
//! ## The solve
//!
//! Each carrier is read as the zero set of a SIGNED DISTANCE with a unit
//! gradient ([`TripleCarrier`]). An analytic carrier is its INFINITE surface —
//! the plane, the cylinder or cone about its axis, the sphere, the torus —
//! never the NURBS patch that happens to carry the face. A patch stops where
//! its face stopped and extended evaluation of it continues along a tangent
//! plane without bound, so a Newton run on it can converge onto a surface that
//! does not exist. A fitted carrier has no such reading; it is its patch, and a
//! point whose foot on it is not a perpendicular foot (it sits on a domain edge
//! the point overruns) is refused rather than accepted on an extrapolation.
//!
//! The iteration is Newton on the three distances: `J·δ = −f`, where the rows
//! of `J` are the three unit normals at the current iterate. Each step moves to
//! the intersection of the three tangent planes, and it converges
//! quadratically wherever the three normals are independent.
//!
//! ## What is reported
//!
//! [`TriplePoint`] carries the iteration count, the RESIDUAL (the largest
//! distance from the point to any of the three carriers), and σ_min, the
//! smallest singular value of the unit-normal matrix. σ_min is the conditioning:
//! three mutually perpendicular walls read 1, and two walls meeting at a
//! dihedral deviation θ read about `√(1 − cos θ)`. Two first-order bounds follow
//! from it, both reported:
//!
//! * `error_bound = √3·residual/σ_min` — how far the returned point can be from
//!   the exact triple point of THESE carriers;
//! * `sensitivity = √3·tolerance/σ_min` — how far the triple point itself moves
//!   when each carrier moves by the model tolerance. A small residual on
//!   near-tangent walls still has a large sensitivity, and that is the case a
//!   residual alone reads as a success.
//!
//! The solve refuses when the sensitivity exceeds the caller's position bar —
//! the incidence bar the heal holds its vertices to, so no new constant enters
//! — as well as when the normals are singular, when the iterate leaves the
//! caller's reach of the seed, when it does not converge, or when it lands on a
//! carrier's focal set (an axis, a centre, a tube circle) where the distance has
//! no gradient. Every refusal quotes what was measured.
//!
//! ## What it does not decide
//!
//! Which root is the right one. A converged point is a root; whether it is the
//! corner the blend was cut from — on the side of each rim the blend removed,
//! and the only admissible root near the corner — is the caller's question,
//! because only the caller holds the rims. [`carrier_crossings`] enumerates the
//! roots along a curve so the caller can ask it.
