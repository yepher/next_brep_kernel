// Move Face by CARRIER RE-INTERSECTION — the operator's construction.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// > "I need the infinite faces of the move face selection to go and intersect
// > themselves with the rest of the solid as the thing gets moved."
//
// `face_move.rs` ENUMERATES CASES. It classifies each boundary edge by the
// carrier pair it joins and picks one of four actions, and every configuration
// nobody enumerated becomes a refusal — which is the root cause the
// 2026-09-21 capability matrix convicts in three places (an in-plane slide
// that refuses because a NEIGHBOUR is curved; a bore wall pushed along its own
// invariant axis; acceptance that is not monotone in the motion).
//
// This road has no case table over configurations. It has exactly three steps,
// and each one asks the same question of every face regardless of what kind of
// surface it carries:
//
//   1. **Carriers.** Every face's carrier is taken UNBOUNDED — stretched to
//      cover the whole body plus the motion — and the selected faces' carriers
//      are moved. Nothing is trimmed at this stage; the body supplies the
//      extent later, which is the whole point.
//   2. **Corners.** Every vertex the moved group touches goes where the rigid
//      motion would put it, corrected by the LEAST amount that lands it on
//      every carrier it must lie on. That one sentence replaces the old road's
//      three-plane solve, its two rim affines, its "ride the fixed edge" lane
//      and its invariant-carrier lane. A corner whose carriers do not meet
//      near the rigid guess refuses, by name.
//   3. **Edges and trims.** Every edge whose geometry the motion disturbed is
//      rebuilt as the section of its own two carriers between its own two
//      re-solved corners, and every face the rebuild touched regrows its
//      carrier around its new boundary and refits its pcurves.
//
// ## What is dispatched on, and what is not
//
// Step 3 does dispatch on the SURFACE PAIR — a plane pair sections in a line, a
// recognized analytic pair sections in closed form
// (`intersect_analytic_pair`), anything else is marched. That is a geometry
// library's business and it is exhaustive by fallback: the marcher has no
// "unsupported pair". What this road does NOT dispatch on is the
// CONFIGURATION — which side of the edge moved, whether the neighbour is
// curved, whether the push is parallel to an axis, how many fixed faces meet
// at a corner. Those are the distinctions the old road's refusals are made of.
//
// ## Honest scope of this slice
//
// * **Topology is preserved.** A motion that needs the topology to CHANGE — a
//   bore breaking out through a new face, a migrating exit hole — is not
//   attempted here; it refuses. Slice 1 measures the geometry road.
// * **Free-form carriers are not stretched.** A fitted NURBS patch keeps its
//   own domain, so a section that leaves it refuses instead of extrapolating.
// * The entry is `move_faces` under `BREP_FACE_MOVE_ROAD=carrier`. Nothing is
//   rewired: with the variable unset, not one byte of the old road's behaviour
//   changes.

/// Which road `move_faces` takes. The old one unless `BREP_FACE_MOVE_ROAD` is
/// set to `carrier` — so an unset environment is the tree's behaviour exactly.

    // vertical walls; moving it down changes nothing about that, and what kept
    // the face off those walls was its own trim, which the re-solve maintains.

    // BEFORE and AFTER readings share every source of error except the motion,

    // at the start while the bore itself does not yet reach it: before
    // non-empty, after non-empty, quiet, and a mouth opens. `step-bore-across`
    // escapes it only because `x = 12` is genuinely outside `x ∈ [30, 60]`; a
    // cell starting nearer the step would show it.
    //
