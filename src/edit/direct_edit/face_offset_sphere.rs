// Push a SPHERICAL analytic face by OFFSETTING its carrier to a concentric
// sphere (backlog #4a Sphere × Plane through-centre + #4b off-centre / sphere).
//
// The methodology mirrors `offset_ruled_face` (a face is a TRIMMED region of an
// infinite carrier surface; to push it we replace the carrier by its offset and
// re-derive the trim against the fixed neighbour carriers):
//
//   * The exact offset of a sphere is a CONCENTRIC sphere of radius r ± δ. It is
//     realised here as the exact uniform scale of the carrier about the sphere
//     centre by k = r_new / r — an AFFINE map, so the scaled surface is byte-for-
//     byte the same rational parameterisation (same knots/weights/seam azimuth/
//     poles), only radially grown. This is the *exact* sphere offset the backlog
//     item calls for; it is NOT the `offset_surface` sample-and-fit, which was
//     tried first and does NOT re-recognise as a sphere for a full-sphere face
//     (its Greville fit degenerates at the poles → `analytic() == None`). The
//     affine scale keeps the pushed face's OWN-ONLY (seam meridian + pole) and
//     THROUGH-CENTRE-rim pcurves valid pointwise: because S′(u,v) = c + k·(S − c),
//     each such edge, scaled about c by the SAME k, lands on S′ at its OWN
//     unchanged pcurve.
//
//   * RIM classification per boundary edge (honest refusal, never a bad solid):
//       - PLANE through the centre → SCALE (4a): a uniform scale about c maps a
//         through-centre plane onto ITSELF, so the scaled great-circle rim IS the
//         exact S′ ∩ plane, no azimuth/seam mismatch.
//       - PLANE off-centre, or a SPHERE neighbour → RECOMPUTE (4b): the scaled
//         rim would leave the fixed carrier, so the rim edge is re-derived as
//         S′ ∩ neighbour. Off-centre small circles: `intersect_plane_quadric`
//         gives radius √((r±δ)²−h²); sphere × sphere: `intersect_sphere_sphere`
//         (both via the public `intersect_analytic_pair`). The rim's pushed-face
//         pcurve is rebuilt on S′; a SEAM-crossing rim (its closure vertex is
//         shared with an own-only meridian — the axis-perpendicular cap case)
//         also rebuilds that meridian as the v-subrange of the offset meridian
//         (an iso-curve preserves the v-parameter exactly, keeping the straight
//         (u,v) pcurve synchronised) and moves its closure vertex to the new
//         latitude. Seam-aligned circle construction is used there so the rim
//         starts on the u = 0 seam.
//       - coaxial cylinder / cone → RECOMPUTE: the exact latitude circle is
//         selected from the coaxial-revolution intersector and the ruled
//         neighbour is extended/retrimmed over the relocated rim.
//       - non-coaxial cylinder / cone, general revolution / torus / free-form
//         → refused.
//     Refused too: a seam-crossing rim on an OBLIQUE plane or a SPHERE neighbour,
//     a non-closed / multi-edge RECOMPUTED rim, a vanished cap (grown sphere no
//     longer reaches the plane / spheres separated or tangent), and a push that
//     collapses or inverts the solid.
//
//   * An OPEN rim on the EXACT-SCALE path is supported, and its corners are
//     carried. A spherical pocket in a box CORNER has three quarter-circle rims,
//     one per box plane, all three through the centre; the scale moves each
//     arc's endpoint radially and the box edge that ends there has its trim slid
//     to follow. That slide is a re-parameterisation, not a re-solve: both
//     planes of such a corner pass through the sphere centre (which is what put
//     the rim on this path), so their intersection line does too and the scale
//     maps the corner along it exactly. A corner that does NOT land on its own
//     fixed edge, or a slide that would collapse or invert that edge's trim,
//     refuses — the open-rim analogue of the recomputed path's closed-rim gate.

    // --- FIXED edges that END on a relocated rim corner --------------------

    // sphere centre — pushed inward produced a solid the validator rejected
    // with `edge 1 curve start does not match vertex 1 (gap=1.5)`.
    //
    // Why nothing caught it. A recomputed rim must be a single CLOSED edge
    // (the guard a hundred lines up); the EXACT-SCALE path a through-centre
    // plane takes has no such guard, because a closed great circle has no
    // endpoint to leave behind. An OPEN rim arc has two, and each is also the
    // end of a FIXED edge of the two neighbour planes — the box's own axis
    // edge. The push scales the corner radially; that edge's CURVE does not
    // move (a plane × plane line the push does not touch) but its TRIM must
    // follow the corner, or the solid carries an edge whose curve no longer
    // reaches its own vertex.
    //
    // The slide is a re-parameterisation, not a re-solve, and provably so: a
    // corner of an exact-scale rim is shared by two planes that BOTH pass
    // through the sphere centre (that is what put the rim on this path), so
    // their intersection line passes through the centre and the uniform scale
    // about the centre maps the corner along it exactly. The projection below
    // is the PROOF of that, not a fit — a corner that does not land on its own

/// over `[t0, t1]`, so the pcurve of a partially-trimmed edge reads as a
/// deviation the size of the trimmed-off overhang. `move_faces` has always
/// paired its planar re-trim with this pass (`face_move.rs`, the
/// `refit_touched_pcurves` call after `retrim_planar_face`); the sphere push
/// did not, which is what made a spherical pocket in a box CORNER fail
/// validation with `max deviation 5.000000` — exactly the length of box edge
/// the original sphere had trimmed away.
