//! Direct editing — Golovanov §6.12: "delete face and heal" and "move a face
//! group" (see [`move_faces`] for the sibling operation's algorithm and
//! honest v1 scope).
//!
//! Removes a transition face (a chamfer, a constant-radius fillet, or any
//! simple 4-sided face) that sits between two larger neighbour faces, and
//! heals the resulting hole by EXTENDING the neighbours' carrier surfaces and
//! RE-INTERSECTING them so the neighbours meet each other directly where the
//! deleted face used to be. The classic use is "undo a chamfer/fillet": the
//! two large planes that flanked the bevel extend and re-intersect at the
//! original sharp edge, the end-cap faces lose the bevel corner, and the
//! solid returns to its pre-blend shape.
//!
//! ## Algorithm (extend → re-intersect → re-trim → reconnect)
//!
//! For a 4-sided transition face `F` with neighbours `N0..N3` (one per
//! boundary edge, in loop order):
//!
//! 1. **Classify.** The two neighbours on OPPOSITE boundary edges whose
//!    (planar) carriers re-intersect in a line passing through `F`'s region
//!    are the *primary* pair (the faces to extend and rejoin). The other two
//!    opposite neighbours are the *lateral* faces (the end caps). Exactly one
//!    opposite pairing must qualify, otherwise the heal is refused.
//! 2. **Re-intersect (extend).** Because analytic planes are unbounded
//!    carriers, the primary pair's intersection line `S` is computed in closed
//!    form (no marching within a bounded patch). `S` clipped by each lateral
//!    plane gives the two recovered corner points — the new sharp edge's
//!    endpoints (`triple points`).
//! 3. **Re-trim.** Every side edge that met `F` at a transition corner is
//!    relocated onto the recovered corner; the deleted face's two support
//!    edges become the single new edge `S` in both primary faces; the two
//!    lateral (cap) edges collapse to points. Each affected neighbour face's
//!    carrier plane is rebuilt large enough to cover its new boundary and all
//!    its pcurves are recomputed against it (analytic planes extend for free).
//! 4. **Reconnect.** `F` and its boundary edges/vertices are pruned, `S` and
//!    its two vertices are inserted, the shell is reassembled, the genus is
//!    preserved, and the result must `validate()` or the whole operation is
//!    refused.
//!
//! ## Covered vs deferred (honest scope of this first slice)
//!
//! - COVERED: a 4-sided chamfer/fillet (or any simple 4-edge transition face)
//!   between two PLANAR primary neighbours with two PLANAR lateral caps, convex
//!   or concave. Chamfer (planar transition) and fillet (cylindrical
//!   transition) both reduce to the same planar-neighbour heal. CURVED
//!   ANALYTIC neighbours route to [`heal_open_transition_mixed`], which
//!   handles both curved primaries (plane × cylinder/ruled revolution
//!   re-intersection) and curved lateral caps (the re-intersection branch is
//!   clipped by curve×surface intersection against the cap's carrier).
//! - COVERED: the WALL OF A THROUGH FEATURE — a drilled bore, or any closed
//!   wall whose two rims are each the whole hole loop of the face it was
//!   punched through. Those neighbours were never meant to meet, so there is
//!   no re-intersection to make: the wall and both hole loops are dropped and
//!   the neighbours close back over the opening, un-drilling the hole. Nothing
//!   is refit (the surviving carriers and outer loops are untouched), and the
//!   genus drops by the handle that goes with it. A mouth that is TANGENT to
//!   the boundary of the face it opens through is covered by the same cap: the
//!   tangency pinches that face and the arrangement splits it, so the rim
//!   arrives as runs of several faces' loops instead of as a hole loop, and
//!   dropping it rejoins the pieces into the face they were (see
//!   `direct_edit/delete_faces.rs`).
//! - COVERED, as a SET: a BAND across a mirrored union — a fillet groove that
//!   runs over a part and down its side, flanked on both sides by cosurface
//!   TWINS of one plane or one fillet cylinder. Its free boundary stops on
//!   setback and tangent lines the band interrupted rather than on a gap
//!   between two carriers, so the rejoin BRIDGES each interrupted line across
//!   the band and the twins close back into one face
//!   (`direct_edit/delete_faces.rs`).
//! - COVERED, as a SET: a whole CORNER BLEND — a three-sided vertex blend and
//!   the three four-sided strips that meet on it. One face at a time it is
//!   ill-posed (a strip's walls re-intersect in the sharp edge, which passes
//!   the corner sphere at `r·√2` and never meets it, so the strip has no cap to
//!   clip against); taken together the walls close a cycle of three carriers
//!   and each strip's corner end is where its own recovered edge meets the
//!   third wall (`direct_edit/corner_heal.rs`).
//! - COVERED, as a SET: a CLOSED BAND — any ring of faces whose free boundary
//!   is one closed run on each of exactly two survivors, such as a stepped nut
//!   pocket sunk over a through bore. It is the closed transition strip with
//!   many faces: the two survivors are extended, re-intersected in closed
//!   form, and each run collapses onto the rim, so the bore runs on up to the
//!   face the pocket opened through (`direct_edit/closed_band.rs`).
//! - COVERED, as a SET: a whole BLEND NETWORK over planar faces — the strips,
//!   vertex blends and mitres a fillet left around a gusset's foot, with more
//!   than one corner and strips that end on other strips. Each cluster of end
//!   edges shrinks to the vertex its planes meet in, and each strip becomes the
//!   sharp edge between its two clusters (`direct_edit/blend_network_heal.rs`).
//!   A cylindrical strip the selection leaves standing is KEPT: where it mitred
//!   into a deleted strip it now ends on the cap plane square to its axis, on
//!   that plane's circular section; any other curved face left beside a network
//!   is refused by name.
//! - COVERED, as a SET (see [`delete_faces_and_heal`] and
//!   `direct_edit/delete_faces.rs`): a BLIND pocket, a blind bore, or a boss —
//!   every face of the feature selected together. One face at a time these are
//!   a multi-face gap with nothing to re-intersect; taken together they are a
//!   PATCH whose free boundary is the whole hole loop of the face the feature
//!   was sunk through, and the same cap that un-drills a bore un-cuts them.
//! - DEFERRED (returns a clear `Err`, never a bad solid): free-form
//!   neighbours (need NURBS carrier extension + marched re-intersect),
//!   transition faces that are not 4-sided (multi-face gaps) — the cap lane
//!   reads any number of boundary edges, but a face that has to be healed by
//!   RE-INTERSECTION still has to be four-sided — a neighbour that
//!   borders the transition more than once (periodic/closed transition), a
//!   BLIND pocket's wall on its own (the wall and its floor disc are a
//!   two-face gap — select the floor as well and the cap lane takes it), a
//!   wall whose removal would SEVER the body into two parts (a post joining
//!   two otherwise separate plates wears a through wall's exact signature, so
//!   the cap checks the shell is still connected before it hands anything
//!   back), and configurations where the neighbours cannot re-intersect
//!   cleanly (non-adjacent healing, or parallel planes that are not a through
//!   wall).
