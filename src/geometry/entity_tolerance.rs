//! Per-entity measured tolerances — the lazy, capped, per-edge/per-vertex band
//! `per-entity-tolerances.md` asks for, derived from the entity's own redundant
//! representations rather than predicted from the model's size.
//!
//! # Why an entity needs its own band
//!
//! Everything in [`crate::tolerance`] is a *policy*: one spatial base `model`,
//! size-coupled at the site through [`KernelTolerances::heal_band`], with named
//! weld floors. That policy answers "how accurate is geometry in this kernel?"
//! with ONE number, and so it cannot say the thing a dirty import needs said:
//! *this* edge is known to be 4.7e-4 sloppy while *that* one is exact. A vendor
//! STEP file commits an edge's 3D curve and its face surfaces as INDEPENDENT
//! approximations; where they disagree, two intersections computed against the
//! two surfaces sharing that edge cannot agree better than the disagreement,
//! no matter how good the marcher is. The residual is a property OF THE EDGE.
//!
//! So: `tol(E) = min(cap_E, max(policy floor, d_meas(E)))`, where `d_meas(E)`
//! is the largest disagreement the edge's own representations show — exactly
//! the quantity [`crate::measure_edge_against_pcurve_image`] measures, taken
//! over every coedge that references the edge.
//!
//! # The direction rule, and why this type may hand out a band at all
//!
//! [`crate::MeasuredTolerance`] deliberately exposes no "band to use" accessor:
//! a *construction* that measured its own error must never widen the band that
//! judges it, or the sloppier the fit the more forgiving its grade. That is
//! invariant **I1**, and it is not weakened here.
//!
//! This type is the other case. Its input is not a fit this kernel just
//! produced but the disagreement already present in geometry the kernel was
//! HANDED, and the band it returns is spent only on *search / pairing*
//! questions — "which of these candidates might be the same point?" — never on
//! an acceptance gate. The acceptance gates ([`crate::BrepSolid::validate`],
//! the boolean's own assembly gate) still run afterwards on the global policy
//! band and still refuse, so a wider search band can only change WHICH
//! candidates are considered, never whether a wrong answer is accepted. Two
//! structural properties keep that honest:
//!
//! * **Capped** (`cap_E`, `cap_V` below). A measurement above the cap does not
//!   buy a wider band: the entity is *defective*, its band pins at the cap, and
//!   the acceptance gate still fails it. We refuse; we do not widen.
//! * **Local.** The band belongs to one edge or one vertex. A poor fit on one
//!   imported edge cannot authorize an unrelated pair of vertices, or a thin
//!   feature elsewhere, to merge — which is the failure mode the plan names.
//!
//! And **I2**: an entity with no measurable band degrades to the policy floor —
//! *narrower*, so more refusals, never a wrong weld. Every consumer therefore
//! reads `max(its own global band, tol(entity))` and behaves exactly as it did
//! before wherever the measurement is absent or zero. Constructed geometry
//! measures ~0, so nothing this kernel builds itself changes behaviour.
//!
//! # Lazy, not stored — which is also the cache-invalidation answer
//!
//! The view borrows a solid and memoizes per id. It is constructed on the
//! operation's ENTRY snapshot and dropped when the operation ends, so a
//! measurement can never outlive the geometry it was taken from: there is no
//! stale residual to carry, because there is no residual carried. A rigid
//! placement changes neither `d_meas` (distances are invariant) nor the answer,
//! and an edit simply means the next operation measures the edited geometry.
//! Persisting a *committed* band on the records — a different question, with
//! its own grow-only commit rule and a codec obligation — stays future work.
