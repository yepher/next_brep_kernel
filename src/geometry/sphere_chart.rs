//! Six pole-free coordinate charts for a spherical carrier — the cube atlas.
//!
//! A sphere in this kernel is ONE exact rational-NURBS surface of revolution
//! over a polar `(azimuth, latitude)` domain.  That domain is not a chart in the
//! differential-geometry sense: it is singular at the two poles (a whole
//! parameter line collapses to one point, and `Su × Sv` vanishes there) and it
//! is periodic in `u`, so a region straddling the seam is not a connected set of
//! parameters at all.  Every trimming, splitting and tessellation decision taken
//! in that domain inherits both defects, and the kernel carries a long tail of
//! special cases — pole caps, seam bands, seam walls, unwrapped covers — that
//! exist only to work around them.
//!
//! This module supplies the alternative: an ATLAS of six regular charts, one per
//! cube face, that between them cover the sphere with no singular point and no
//! periodic identification.  Chart `k` maps the square `(s, t) ∈ [-1, 1]²` to
//!
//! ```text
//!     p(s, t) = centre + radius · normalize(n_k + s·e_k + t·f_k)
//! ```
//!
//! with `(e_k, f_k, n_k)` a right-handed orthonormal frame — the central
//! projection of a cube face onto its circumscribed sphere.  The map is a
//! diffeomorphism on the closed square, its Jacobian never degenerates, and it
//! is exact: every image point lies on the sphere to the accuracy of one
//! `normalize`, so NOTHING about the carrier's geometry is approximated by using
//! it.  The map does contain a square root, so it is deliberately NOT offered as
//! a NURBS patch — the exact rational sphere surface remains the geometry of
//! record and the charts are a computational device layered over it.
//!
//! # What the atlas is aligned to
//!
//! The cube basis is the sphere's own recognition frame, so `basis[2]` is the
//! polar axis and the two degenerate poles land at the CENTRES of the `±z`
//! charts.  A former pole is then an ordinary interior point of a regular chart:
//! a cut through it is no more special than a cut anywhere else.  Because the
//! basis is read off the surface, two call sites looking at the same surface
//! always build the same atlas — a prerequisite for the shared-sample rules
//! below.
//!
//! # Sharing, and why it is the whole problem
//!
//! Charts are internal.  They must mint no face, no edge, no name, and above all
//! no crack.  The watertight tessellator's guarantee is that every edge is
//! sampled ONCE and both adjacent faces consume the same positions; an
//! artificial chart boundary has to inherit exactly that guarantee.  Three rules
//! do it, and they are the reason this module owns the sample generation rather
//! than leaving it to each consumer:
//!
//! 1. **A cube edge is subdivided once.**  [`cube_edge_parameters`] returns the
//!    subdivision of a cube edge in the edge's OWN parameter `q`, and both
//!    charts that meet along that edge read the same list through
//!    [`ChartSide::edge`].  Neither chart may add a point of its own.
//! 2. **A corner belongs to no chart.**  The eight cube corners are named by
//!    [`corner_index`], and the three charts and three cube edges meeting at one
//!    all address it by that name, so ownership is never ambiguous.
//! 3. **A crossing is computed once.**  Where a trim polyline leaves one chart,
//!    [`arc_chart_crossings`] returns the crossing as a function of the segment
//!    alone — never of which chart is asking — so the two charts that share it
//!    get the identical point, and the same value can be pushed back into the
//!    SHARED edge-sample table so the neighbouring face gets it too.
//!
//! # Classification
//!
//! [`SphericalRegion`] decides inside/outside for a trimmed spherical face
//! without reference to any chart, by the signed solid angle each trim loop
//! subtends at the query point (Van Oosterom & Strackee's formula).  It is
//! pole-free and seam-free by construction: a slit — the seam traversed once
//! each way, or a collapsed pole loop — cancels exactly, and needs no special
//! case.  Trimming and triangulation share this one classifier so they cannot
//! disagree about where the material is.
