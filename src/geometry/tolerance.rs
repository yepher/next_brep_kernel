//! # Tolerance taxonomy — which bands may scale with part size, and which must not
//!
//! Every numeric tolerance in this kernel belongs to exactly one of the KINDS
//! below.  The distinction that matters for correctness is whether a band may be
//! **size-coupled** (widened in proportion to the local part extent) or must stay
//! a **tight absolute** floor.  Getting this wrong is not academic: coupling the
//! base spatial `model` tolerance to part size was tried and REJECTED because
//! `model` also feeds the fit-accuracy fields, and scaling it degraded SSI curve
//! fitting enough to produce invalid boolean topology (see the B1 finding in
//! `revolve_pole_union_fixture`).  The rules:
//!
//! * **Identity / coincidence** — "are these two entities the same point / are
//!   these surfaces the same surface?".  MAY size-couple: a big part legitimately
//!   needs a proportionally wider identity band.  Couple it *at the site* via
//!   [`KernelTolerances::heal_band`] (`max(model, diagonal * k)`), taking the
//!   local `diagonal`/extent explicitly — never by inflating the global `model`.
//!
//! * **Fit-accuracy** — `intersection_fit`, the SSI/CSI marcher, curve/surface
//!   fitting.  MUST stay TIGHT.  Do NOT size-couple: this is "how closely must
//!   committed geometry agree?", and loosening it silently degrades every export.
//!   This is the field that broke `revolve_pole_union` when coupled (B1).
//!
//! * **Weld / sew** — the distinct-vertex / weld radius used when knitting
//!   endpoints and edges together (assembler weld, endpoint commit, vertex
//!   merge).  A *search* radius answering "which entities might match?", floored
//!   to a small absolute so noise-free models still weld; see the named weld
//!   accessors on [`KernelTolerances`].
//!
//! * **Knot-parameter** — knot-vector identity and numerical knot dedup.  Two
//!   distinct purposes at two distinct values: knot IDENTITY
//!   (`KNOT_IDENTITY_TOL`, 1e-9) and numerical knot DEDUP (`KNOT_DEDUP_EPS`,
//!   1e-12), both single-sourced in `curve.rs`.  Parameter-space, not spatial;
//!   derived from a spatial band only via [`parametric_tolerance`].
//!
//! * **Angular** — direction/normal agreement in radians (`angular`).  A fixed
//!   absolute; does not scale with part size.
//!
//! * **Strict-interior** — small skip epsilons that keep a parameter off the
//!   exact domain end (so knot insertion / split does not refuse it).  Fixed,
//!   derived from the knot-identity band, not size-coupled.
//!
//! * **Floating-point floor** — the `1e-12`/`1e-15` guards that keep a division
//!   or a degenerate direction from blowing up.  Never a modelling tolerance.
//!
//! Bottom line: identity/weld bands couple to size *locally* through
//! [`KernelTolerances::heal_band`]/[`solid_scale`]; fit-accuracy, angular, and
//! the floating-point floors stay tight.

///   error the moment a part is placed away from the origin.
