//! Natural extension of a NURBS surface: the terminal Bézier span of one
//! parameter direction, extrapolated by a bounded parameter increment and
//! appended as a fresh span.
//!
//! This is the real answer to the question `evaluate_extended` only pretends
//! to answer. `evaluate_extended` continues an open direction along the
//! boundary TANGENT PLANE, without bound and without a surface: a solver that
//! has no solution slides onto that fictitious plane and converges there, far
//! outside the patch, with nothing downstream able to tell. An extension built
//! here is a `NurbsSurface` — the analytic continuation of the terminal
//! polynomial, with a domain that ends somewhere, so a solve that leaves the
//! extension leaves the surface and is refused rather than answered.
//!
//! The construction (Piegl & Tiller §5.3 knot insertion, plus the blossom form
//! of de Casteljau) is:
//!
//! 1. Refine a scratch copy so the last interior knot reaches multiplicity
//!    `degree`; the terminal `degree + 1` control points of each control line
//!    are then the Bézier control points of the terminal span `[a, b]`.
//! 2. Run one de Casteljau triangle in HOMOGENEOUS coordinates at the
//!    off-interval parameter, and read the new span's control points off an
//!    anti-diagonal of it. For the high side the continuation over `[b, b + δ]`
//!    is `cᵢ = f(b^{p-i}, x^i)` with `x = b + δ`; for the low side the
//!    continuation over `[a - δ, a]` is `eᵢ = f(x^{p-i}, a^i)` with
//!    `x = a - δ`. Both are one triangle with a single ratio.
//! 3. Append (or prepend) those `degree` control lines and the matching knots.
//!
//! The emitted surface keeps the input's knots and control net VERBATIM over
//! the original domain — nothing is refined in the output — so the original
//! parameterization survives exactly. Two things follow: evaluation inside the
//! old domain is bit-identical to the input's, and every pcurve already drawn
//! on the face stays valid with no remap (unlike the analytic
//! `extend_ruled_carrier`, which rescales v and has to walk the coedges).
//!
//! Every refusal is typed and carries the quantity that was measured.
