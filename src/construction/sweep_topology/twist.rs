/// out by the counter-twist, so the section comes back rolled by exactly the
/// requested twist `T` about the PATH at station 0. The sweep closes only if that
/// roll carries the section onto ITSELF. So `T` must be a rotational symmetry of
/// the section about the path's own axis, `T ≡ 2π·n/k (mod 2π)` for a section with
/// `k` such rotations. `k = 1` for any section with no symmetry about the path,
/// including a symmetric one drawn off it, so only whole turns close there.
///
/// READ CURVE FOR CURVE, AS DRAWN. A wall per section curve must land on another
/// curve after the lap, end for end, with the same degree, knots and weights, so the
/// rotation is found on the curves' control points and not on the region they
/// bound. A circle drawn as two half-arcs has `k = 2`, not a continuum; a square
/// drawn with one side split has `k = 1`.
///
/// `axis_point` and `axis` are the path's first point and unit tangent there, and
/// the rotation is right-handed about `axis`, the sense the frame rolls in.
/// `floor` is the lane's own position floor, which is how far a control point may
/// land from its image and still be the same point. The angle itself is matched at
/// ROUND-OFF, not at a size: a twist that misses a closing value by `δ` would put
/// the seam `ρ·δ` apart, which grows with the section, so `90.001°` is refused
/// on a square.
