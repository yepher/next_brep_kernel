///
/// # Why one shared loop exists at all
///
/// Write `û`, `v̂` for the two segment directions at a joint `P`, `θ` for the
/// angle between them. The bisector plane's normal is
///
/// ```text
///     n̂ = (û + v̂)/|û + v̂|,   so   û·n̂ = v̂·n̂ = cos(θ/2)
/// ```
///
/// — equal and positive, which is what makes it the MITRE plane rather than
/// just some plane through the joint. Reflection `R` in that plane maps
/// `û → −v̂`, and composed with the joint's own rotation `Rot` (the minimal
/// rotation taking `û` to `v̂` about `ŵ = û × v̂`, which is exactly what
/// `pathAlign` does to the section at the joint) it satisf
/// `R ∘ Rot = S`, the reflection in the plane through `P` perpendicular to `û`.
/// Since `S` moves a point only ALONG `û`, and `R` maps lines along `û` to
/// lines along `v̂` while fixing the bisector plane pointwise,
///
/// ```text
///     Proj_v̂ ∘ Rot = Proj_û          (pointwise, for every point in space)
/// ```
///
/// The arriving section projected along `û` onto the bisector plane IS the
/// departing (rotated) section projected along `v̂` onto it. The shared loop is
/// therefore exact, for ANY section and ANY joint angle — it is not a fit, and
/// it does not need the section to be circular, centred on the path, or square
/// to it. That identity is the whole construction: this builder never forms
/// `Rot` at all, it just projects each ring along the current segment's own
/// direction onto the next plane, and projections along one direction compose
/// (`Proj_Q ∘ Proj_P = Proj_Q`), so the ring it lands on is the next segment's
/// section's own projection.
///
/// # What is built, exactly
///
/// `n` segments and a section of `m` curves give `n + 1` RINGS when the path is
/// OPEN — the start cap loop, one mitre loop per interior joint, the end cap loop
/// — and `n` when it is CLOSED, one per joint, the ring index wrapping. Each is
/// the affine image of the section under a parallel projection, so each is a
/// NURBS curve of the SAME degree, knots and weights (a projection is affine; a
/// circular arc mitres to an exact rational ellipse arc, not a fitted one). Wall
/// `(i, j)` is the ruled surface between ring `i`'s and ring `i+1`'s `j`-th curve,
/// and because both are projections of the same section along the same `û_i`,
/// every ruling is exactly along `û_i`: the wall is the exact swept surface of
/// that section curve, and all four of its pcurves are exact PARAMETER LINES.
///
/// ```text
///     OPEN:   V = (n+1)·m   E = (n+1)·m ring + n·m side   F = n·m walls + 2 caps
///             V − E + F = 2                                      (genus 0)
///     CLOSED: V = n·m       E = n·m ring + n·m side       F = n·m walls, no caps

/// ```
///
/// A CLOSED run has one fewer ring than an open one with the same segment count —
/// its rings are the `n` mitre loops and nothing else, because the loop that
/// would have been the start cap IS the loop that would have been the end cap —
/// and the walls close the surface on their own. A frame is a torus: one hole,
/// `V − E + F = 0`, `genus 1`.
///
/// No interior face either way: the two sweeps at a joint meet AT the shared
/// loop, so there is nothing between them to cap. That is the difference from
/// unioning one prism per segment, which leaves the inner wedge doubly covered
/// and the outer wedge empty.
///
/// # Why a CLOSED loop closes — the closing-frame policy
///
/// The section is carried from one segment to the next by the joint's own
/// rotation `Rot_j`, the minimal rotation `d_{j−1} → d_j` about the joint point,
/// which is what `pathAlign` does at a corner. Carried once round a closed loop
/// it comes back transformed by
///
/// ```text
///     M = Rot_0 ∘ Rot_{n−1} ∘ … ∘ Rot_1
/// ```
///
/// and the frame CLOSES exactly when `M` leaves the section where the ring at
/// joint 0 already puts it. For a PLANAR loop it does, and for two reasons that
/// compose:
///
///   - every `Rot_j` turns about the SAME axis — the path plane's normal — so
///     they commute and `M`'s rotation part is the rotation by the loop's TOTAL
///     TURNING. For a closed planar polyline that is `Σ θ_j = ±2π` signed (Hopf's
///     Umlaufsatz: a reflex corner subtracts, so an L-shaped frame closes as
///     surely as a rectangular one), and a `±2π` rotation is the IDENTITY. `M` is
///     therefore a pure TRANSLATION.
///   - a pure translation that maps segment 0's LINE to itself is a translation
///     ALONG `d_0`, and `M` does map it to itself: `Rot_1` carries line 0 onto
///     line 1, `Rot_2` line 1 onto line 2, …, `Rot_0` line `n−1` back onto
///     line 0. And a translation along `d_0` is exactly what `Proj_{d_0}`
///     annihilates.
///
/// So `M` moves the section only where the projection onto joint 0's plane cannot
/// see it. Ring 0 is the placed section's own footprint on the CLOSING joint's
/// bisector plane, and the ring the chain of projections lands on after the last
/// segment IS ring 0 — identically, not approximately. The closing wall is
/// therefore built exactly like every other wall, between two rings that are one
/// section projected along one direction, and the frame has no seam.
///
/// The builder MEASURES that rather than asserting it: it takes the last
/// projection, compares it to ring 0 control point by control point, and refuses
/// if the two differ by more than the position floor. On a planar frame the
/// residual is rounding — 0 exactly on a 40 × 28 rectangular frame, 1.0e-14 with
/// its section centred, 4.4e-15 on a triangle, against floors of ~1e-4, so ten
/// orders inside the bar; the check is there for the path where the identity does
/// NOT hold.
///
/// A SPATIAL closed polyline does not. Its joint axes stop being parallel, the
/// rotations no longer commute, and `M` is a SCREW about segment 0's line: the
/// translation along `d_0` the projection cannot see, plus a ROLL about `d_0` by
/// the loop's HOLONOMY ([`frame_holonomy`]), which it can. That roll is the solid
/// angle enclosed by the spherical polygon the segment DIRECTIONS trace, modulo
/// `2π`. Each minimal rotation is parallel transport along the great-circle arc
/// between two directions, so Gauss–Bonnet applies. A planar loop's directions
/// run along one great circle, whose hemisphere is `2π`, the identity.
///
/// # The COUNTER-TWIST, for a spatial loop
///
/// The frame closes with the smallest roll that closes it ([`SweepClosure`]), and
/// only where it has to. A holonomy that reads zero to the joint rotations' own
/// rounding — a loop whose indicatrix encloses a whole number of hemispheres,
/// which every loop with a mirror symmetry does — is built exactly as a planar
/// frame is and reports no twist. Otherwise `−holonomy` is SHARED over the
/// segments in proportion to their length. Each share is under `π/2`, because no
/// side of a closed polygon is longer than the other sides together. Each share
/// is laid down as a ROLL ABOUT ITS SEGMENT'S OWN LINE.
///
/// WHERE on the segment is forced. A roll AT a joint cannot keep the shared loop:
/// `Proj_v̂ ∘ Rot' = Proj_û` needs every point's displacement under `Rot'` to lie
/// along `v̂`, which pins `Rot'` to the minimal rotation and leaves no roll. Along
/// the segment it can: a roll about one segment's line, conjugated through the
/// joint rotation, is the same roll about the next line, so the mitre identity
/// still holds pointwise between the section as it ARRIVES and as it DEPARTS.
/// What a roll cannot do is happen inside a mitre's own reach, because the trim
/// there is the projection of ONE section. So each share lives on its segment's
/// MIDDLE HALF, `[L/4, 3L/4]` from the joint it departs, and the quarter-runs
/// either side stay exact prisms. The run is fixed by the PATH alone: a hole loop
/// or a second region is swept in a call of its own, and a run placed from each
/// section's own mitres would roll a hole somewhere its outer wall does not. The
/// section decides only whether its mitres leave that run untrimmed.
///
/// The twisted piece is EXACT, not fitted. A roll by `φ` is rational in
/// `u = tan(φ/2)`: `cos φ = (1−u²)/(1+u²)` and `sin φ = 2u/(1+u²)`. Taking
/// `u = tan(β/2)·(3v² − 2v³)` gives a roll that starts and ends at ZERO RATE, so
/// the wall is tangent-continuous into both prisms. With the axial advance linear
/// in `v`, every control point shares the weight `1 + u(v)²`, so the wall's
/// section at `v` is the section rigidly rolled by `φ(v)` in its own
/// perpendicular plane. That is a degree-7 rational patch in `v` on the section's
/// own knots in `u`. The whole side (prism, roll, prism) is ONE face on a
/// piecewise-Bézier `v`, so a frame still has one wall per (segment × section
/// curve), named exactly as before.
///
/// MATERIAL. A roll about the path keeps every perpendicular slice's area, so the
/// straight runs keep `A·L` (Cavalieri). The joint exchange does NOT carry over
/// unchanged. It is `tan(θⱼ/2)` times the section's first moment across the bend,
/// and a roll moves an offset section's centroid relative to each bend plane. The
/// law keeps its form, `V = A·ΣL − 2·Σⱼ Mⱼ·tan(θⱼ/2)`, with `Mⱼ` read off the
/// section AS IT ARRIVES at joint `j`, rolled by every share laid down before it.
///
/// # A REQUESTED twist
///
/// A twist the caller asks for joins the counter-twist in the shares, so after the
/// lap the section's slice square to the first side comes back rolled by exactly
/// the requested angle. That closes only when the roll carries the slice onto
/// itself ([`closing_twist`]): a whole number of turns, or a step of its own
/// symmetry about the path. Under a fractional step each curve lands on another,
/// so the closing side's walls end on ring 0's curve `curve_shift` along — still
/// one wall per (segment × section curve). A requested twist can hand a side more
/// than the quarter turn a counter-twist alone never exceeds, and the rational roll
/// is written in `tan(β/2)`, so such a share is laid down as several equal rolls,
/// each zero-rate at both ends, over equal runs of the middle half. A frame with a
/// zero holonomy and a requested twist takes the twisted construction with the
/// requested twist alone. An OPEN run takes no twist.
///
/// REFUSED BY NAME, each refusal quoting its measurement:
///   - a segment with NO UNTRIMMED MIDDLE: a mitre ring reaches into the middle
///     half its share rolls over;
///   - a middle too SHORT for its share. The roll's peak rate `ω` would tilt the
///     wall, at the section's farthest reach `ρ` from the path, past the
///     transversality floor the mitre planes and the prism builder refuse a
///     grazing sweep at: `ρ·ω ≤ √(1/0.1² − 1)`, derived from
///     [`MITER_TRANSVERSALITY_FLOOR`]. The rate is bounded by `3·tan(|β|/2)/Λ`
///     over a middle of length `Λ = L/2`, which is a bound rather than a sample.
///     Because shares go by length, that is about `3·|holonomy|/perimeter` on
///     every segment, so a short segment does not roll faster than a long one; the
///     bar binds for a section reaching about the perimeter from the path. A
///     share is never pushed onto a neighbour.
///
/// MATERIAL at a joint follows from the trim and needs no rule of its own: a
/// section point on the INNER side of the bend sits on the far side of the
/// bisector plane and is folded away, one on the OUTER side is extended past the
/// joint to reach the plane. Integrated over the section the two exchange
/// `tan(θ/2)·∫ξ dA` — zero for a section centred on the path (so the solid is
/// exactly `area × Σ segment length`), and the wedge term otherwise.
///
/// FACE ORDER, which is the caller's naming contract:
/// `[segment 0's walls in INPUT-curve order, segment 1's walls, …, START cap,
/// END cap]` — and for a CLOSED run the same list without the two caps, since
/// there are none.
///
/// # What it refuses
///
/// - a COLLAPSED bend — a joint at or past [`fold_angle`];
/// - a section plane grazing the path (`Rigid` placement can draw one), the
///   same sliver the prism builder refuses;
/// - a bend too TIGHT for the section: the fold reaches back past the far end of
///   a segment, so the bisector plane cuts the section a SECOND time and the
///   inner side of the solid intersects itself. On a FRAME every segment is
///   trimmed at BOTH ends, so this is also the OVERLAP refusal — a section wider
///   across the bend than a side is long leaves that side no wall at all;
/// - (CLOSED only) a SELF-CROSSING loop: two non-adjacent segments of the frame
///   path meeting or passing through each other. The mitres are all still
///   buildable there, and the solid they build passes through itself;
/// - (a COUNTER-TWISTED frame only) a segment with no untrimmed middle, or one
///   too short for its share of the twist, as above;
/// - (a requested twist only) a twist that does not carry the section's slice onto
///   itself, quoting the nearest twists that do.
///
/// `section` must already be PLACED in world (the caller's placement mode is
/// resolved before this runs) and validated closed and planar —
/// `profile_anchor` is what does that validating, and `section_normal` is the
/// normal it published.

    // --- 6. CLOSURE. Ring `segments` is the section carried once round the whole
    //     loop and projected back onto joint 0's plane. On a PLANAR loop the
    //     construction says it IS ring 0: the lap's rigid motion is a translation
    //     along `d₀` (see the closing-frame policy above) and `Proj_{d₀}`
    //     annihilates exactly that. So the builder KEEPS ring 0, welds the last
    //     wall to it, and reads the difference as the residual of a claimed
    //     identity rather than as a gap to be closed.
    //
    //     The floor is `tolerance · travel`, the same one the room check uses, and
    //     for the same reason: below it two rings are one ring under rounding. On
    //     the planar test frames the residual reads 0 to 1.0e-14 against floors of
    //     ~1e-4, ten orders inside the bar.
    //
    //     WHICH frames take the counter-twist is decided on the PATH, never on the
    //     section: a hole loop and a second region are swept in calls of their own,
    //     and a decision that read their sections could roll a hole where its outer
    //     wall does not. And it is decided at ROUND-OFF, not at a geometric size: the
    //     error of skipping a roll `h` is `ρ·h`, which grows with the section, so a
    //     geometric bar would weld a seam on a large enough section. What the bar
    //     separates is a holonomy that IS zero — a planar loop, or a spatial one
    //     whose indicatrix encloses a whole number of hemispheres, like the skew
    //     hexagon round a cube's edges or any loop with a mirror symmetry — from
    //     the product of the joint rotations' rounding, a few `ε` per joint. Such a
    //     loop is built exactly as a planar frame is, and its residual is still
    //     MEASURED below.
    //
    //     A REQUESTED twist rides on the counter-twist, shared the same way. It is
    //     asked first whether it CLOSES: after the lap the section comes back
    //     rolled by it about segment 0's line, and since every wall is swept along
    //     its segment, what must map onto itself is the section's slice square to
    //     that line — ring 0 projected along `d₀` onto the plane through the joint
    //     perpendicular to `d₀` (projections along one direction compose, so ring
    //     0's slice is the section's). Read on the WINDING-NORMALIZED ring, whose
    //     curve order the rings and ids use ([`closing_twist`]).
