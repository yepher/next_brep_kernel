//! The swept envelope TRIMMED at its own self-intersection.
//!
//! Past `ρκ = 1` the sections a sweep skins through CROSS, and the wall lofted
//! between them passes through itself. The correct solid there is not "no
//! solid": it is the union of the swept SECTIONS — the envelope trimmed where
//! it turns back through itself — which for the one configuration with a closed
//! form is a REVOLVE, and is built here as one.
//!
//! ## The configuration, and why it is the only one
//!
//! A circle of radius `r` carried square to a planar CIRCULAR path of radius
//! `R` sweeps a solid of REVOLUTION: every placed section is the start section
//! rotated about the path's own axis, so the union of the placed DISCS is the
//! revolution of one disc. In the meridian half-plane that disc is centred at
//! `(R, 0)` with radius `r`, and for `r > R` it CROSSES the axis — which is the
//! same statement as `ρκ ≥ 1`, since `ρ = r` and `κ = 1/R` at every station.
//!
//! The union in the half-plane is therefore the disc TRUNCATED at the axis
//! together with the REFLECTION of the part that crossed, and each of those is
//! revolved separately:
//!
//! ```text
//!     near arc (x ≥ 0) + the axis chord, revolved Θ  →  the APPLE
//!     far  arc (x ≤ 0) + the axis chord, revolved Θ  →  the LEMON
//! ```
//!
//! The far arc already SITS in the half-plane at azimuth π (its points have
//! `x < 0`), so the same `+Θ` revolve carries it over the azimuths `[π, π+Θ]` —
//! which is where the section's far side really does sweep material. The two
//! lobes are two BODIES: they meet only along the axis chord, and a shell is
//! edge-connected by definition.
//!
//! A FULL turn is the exception and the one-body case: the lemon then lies
//! INSIDE the apple (every point of the reflected part is within the truncated
//! disc), so the apple alone is the swept solid — the outer sheet of the
//! SPINDLE TORUS, with a dimple at each pole.
//!
//! ## The closed forms
//!
//! Pappus on each half-plane region, with `A_seg` the area of the circular
//! segment the axis cuts off and `M = R·A_seg − (2/3)(r² − R²)^{3/2}` its first
//! moment `∫∫_{x<0} x dA` (negative):
//!
//! ```text
//!     A_seg   = r²·acos(R/r) − R·√(r² − R²)
//!     V_apple = Θ·(π r² R − M)
//!     V_lemon = Θ·(−M)
//!     V_apple(2π) = 2π²R r² + V_lemon(2π)          the ring formula plus the lemon
//! ```
//!
//! `R = 0` reads `(4π/3)r³` (a sphere) and `R → r` reads `Θ π r² R` with the
//! lemon vanishing (the horn torus), which is what pins the algebra at both
//! ends.
//!
//! ## What it does NOT cover, and says so
//!
//! A non-circular section, a section not centred on the path under `Rigid`, a
//! path that is not one circle, and a turn in `[π, 2π)` — where the far lobe
//! overlaps the near one and the union stops being two disjoint revolves. Each
//! is refused BY NAME with the measurement that decided it, and the tight-bend
//! refusal carries the reason so a caller learns which half of the
//! configuration it missed.
