/// profile's own position and its angle to the path are both discarded — every
/// sweep comes out centred on the path and square to it. That is the classic
/// swept-surface reading, and it is what `SWP` builds.
///
/// `Rigid` CARRIES the profile: the section at station `k` is the profile moved
/// by the same rigid motion the PATH undergoes between its start and station
/// `k`,
///
/// ```text
///     section_k(x) = P_k + R_k · (x − P_0)
/// ```
///
/// where `R_k` is the rotation taking the start frame `(T_0, r_0, s_0)` to the
/// station's `(T_k, r_k, s_k)`. The profile keeps its drawn POSITION and its
/// drawn ANGLE to the path; what changes along the sweep is only what the path
/// itself does. Two consequences are the whole point of the mode:
///   - a STRAIGHT path makes every `R_k` the identity, so the section merely
///     translates and the result is the oblique prism `extrude_profile_brep`
///     builds from the same profile and vector — `pathAlign` and `translate`
///     agree on a straight path rather than merely having the same volume;
///   - a circular ARC makes `R_k` the rotation about the ARC'S OWN CENTRE AXIS
///     (for a planar path the RMF's transport rotation IS that rotation), so
///     the profile is carried round the pivot and the end cap arrives at the
///     angle the start cap had to the tangent. A full-circle path degenerates
///     to exactly a revolve of the profile about that axis;
///   - a HELIX makes `R_k` the SCREW about the helix's own axis — but only when
///     the path says it is one ([`SweepPath::screw_axes`]), because the frame
///     that realizes it is not the RMF. A helix is carried into itself by the
///     screw, which spins the tangent frame at the helix's torsion; the RMF has
///     no spin about the tangent by construction, so it rolls away from the
///     screw by `∫τ ds` (169.75° over three turns of a radius-5, pitch-5 coil).
///     A helix segment's stations are therefore framed off its axis
///     (`screw_reference`), and every other segment keeps the RMF — which on a
///     chain of lines and arcs in ANY planes is still exactly each arc's turn
///     about its own centre, composed. The two hand over at a joint without a
///     roll.
///
/// Why not one frame for every curve: the Frenet frame is the screw on a helix
/// but spins where a spatial curve nearly straightens (a planar S-cubic lifted
/// 1e-3 out of its plane carries a 180° roll through the inflection, which 32
/// stations read as 0.4°), and one axis fitted to the whole run is the screw on
/// a helix but rolls a two-arc spatial chain by up to 256° against its arcs.
///
/// `R_k = F_k · F_0ᵀ` does NOT depend on which perpendicular `r_0` the RMF was
/// seeded with: re-seeding rolls `F_0` and every `F_k` by the same angle about
/// the tangent, and the two rolls cancel in the product. That matters because
/// `Transplant` maps `pu → r_k` directly, so under IT the profile's roll about

    //   the tangent — so this is not a different frame from the open lane's, it is

    //   matters for exactly one reason: written down, it returns to itself at the
    //   seam EXACTLY, so the ring's last section meets its first with no residual
    //   roll to skin away.

    //   SPATIAL RING: the open lane's transported frame, carried one step further
    //   round the wrap to MEASURE the roll it returns with (the holonomy), and
    //   counter-twisted by that roll linearly in arc length so the lap's last span
    //   rolls at the same rate as every other and the ring meets itself

/// Helical sweep (§5.7): sweep a CLOSED PLANAR profile loop along a helix of

/// `axis_direction`, rising `pitch` per revolution for `turns` revolutions.
///
/// Sample a helix — `turns` revolutions about `axis_direction` from
/// `axis_origin`, starting at angle `start_angle` (radians, measured from the
/// axis frame's `u`) and rising `pitch` per turn, the radius running linearly
/// from `start_radius` to `end_radius` — uniformly in angle: 64 stations per
/// turn (at least 9, at most 4097 in total, so beyond 64 turns the per-turn
/// density thins). Returns the points and their chord parameters `s ∈ [0,1]`
/// (uniform-in-angle IS chord-length for a constant-radius helix, which is
/// what the averaged-knot interpolation assumes). `left_handed` winds the
/// angle the other way. The axis frame is `w = axis`, `u` = the component of
/// `reference` perpendicular to the axis (so angle zero points AT the
/// reference — the helix feature's local +X, or its start point), falling
/// back to `w.perpendicular()` when there is no usable reference, and
/// `v = w × u`. Shared by [`sweep_profile_helix`] and the HX feature, so the
/// coil a sweep builds and the edge a helix feature publishes agree exactly.
///
/// Errors on a degenerate axis, non-finite inputs, `turns ≤ 0`, more than 256
/// turns, a negative radius or pitch, or a helix that is a single point (both
/// radii AND the pitch zero).

/// correctness, at high turn counts).

/// GUARDS beyond the path sweep's own: the path sweep documents
/// self-intersection as caller responsibility, so the helix variant — which
/// knows its curvature analytically — rejects the two garbage modes itself:
///   • fold-over: the helix curvature radius (R² + c²)/R (c = pitch/2π) must
///     exceed the profile's max extent about its centroid, or the tube folds
///     through itself on the inner side (the torus tube-radius > major-radius
///     failure, pitch-relaxed);
///   • coil collision (turns ≥ 1): the normal gap between consecutive coils,
///     pitch·2πR/√((2πR)² + pitch²), must exceed the profile diameter.
/// Both use the profile's max sample distance from its centroid — conservative
/// for asymmetric profiles (extent in a harmless direction still counts), but
/// a false reject beats silent garbage.
///
/// SHALLOW COILS BUILD. They did not until 2026-09-08: the loft measured its
/// advance by the END-TO-END chord, which on a whole-turn helix is purely
/// AXIAL while both caps face nearly tangentially, so `|n·chord|` fell under
/// the loft's 0.1 sliver band and everything with pitch ≲ 0.63·R — most
/// springs — was refused. The loft measures the advance at each END now
/// (`loft_topology::basic::advance_from`), which is the direction the tube
/// actually grows through the cap it is orienting, so the band only ever
/// catches a real sliver.
