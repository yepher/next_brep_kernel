//! Is a constructed result SOUND enough to return — and if not, can it be
//! repaired rather than refused?
//!
//! `validate()` is an incidence test and says nothing about a body passing
//! through itself. [`crate::solid_self_intersections`] does, in two forms: two
//! faces CROSSING, and one face FOLDING through itself. Neither changes the
//! volume in a way a closed-form oracle can see — a shape can enclose exactly
//! the right amount of space while passing through itself — so a lane that
//! returns one reports success for a different result. That is the failure
//! mode this module exists to stop.
//!
//! ## Repair first, refuse second
//!
//! A self-intersection is not automatically a dead end. Where two faces of one
//! body cross along a curve and the material beyond that curve is a sliver,
//! the answer is to SPLIT both faces along their carriers' exact intersection
//! and drop the pieces that should not be there —
//! [`resolve_face_crossing`]. Only when that cannot be bounded does the lane
//! refuse.
//!
//! The drop is closed under one rule — a face left holding a boundary no other
//! face answers for bordered the dropped material — and that rule has two
//! answers. DROPPING the face is right when the unanswered boundary is the
//! whole of what it contributed: a tail beside a tail. RE-TRIMMING it — taking
//! the unanswered coedges off and re-linking what is left into closed loops —
//! is right when the body keeps the face and only part of its boundary went,
//! which is the only way a BREAKOUT closes. A bore carried out through a side
//! wall leaves the mouth flat holding the stretch of a corner edge that now
//! runs INSIDE the bore and the arc of its own mouth ring that now runs
//! OUTSIDE the body; dropping the flat is absurd, and taking those two coedges
//! off it merges its mouth loop into its outer loop, which is the topology a
//! breakout has. The enumeration runs under the dropping closure first and
//! reaches the re-trimming one only where that resolved nothing at all, so the
//! second can turn a refusal into a repair and can never change a repair this
//! module already made.
//!
//! A FOLD is different and is refused outright here. A face folded through
//! itself is a TRIM that was never constructed: the answer is to carve the
//! folded part of the trim away at the point the carrier is built
//! (`offset/carve.rs`), not to repair the finished body. Refusing it by name
//! is what sends the caller to the lane that can fix it.
//!
//! ## A hole that left its face
//!
//! The scan reads the body as a SURFACE: it convicts two faces that cross and
//! one face that folds. Neither describes a face whose HOLE loop has wandered
//! off the face it is a hole in — the trim is nonsense but nothing crosses,
//! because the wall the hole opens into has gone with it. A direct edit that
//! carries a bore clean off the body builds exactly that: `validate()` is an
//! incidence test and passes, the scan finds no pair to convict, and the
//! divergence-theorem volume of a cylinder is blind to where its axis sits, so
//! the wrong body measures right to the last bit. [`refuse_holes_leaving_their_faces`]
//! is the floor for it, and it runs LAST — after the repair, on whatever body
//! the repair left — so a crossing the repair can take is still taken.
//!
//! ## And a hole that left its face ONTO A NEIGHBOUR
//!
//! That floor convicts two different things, and only one of them has no right
//! answer. A bore dragged CLEAN OFF the body has none: the carrier misses the
//! solid, and there is nothing to cut at any extent. A bore dragged so that its
//! exit mouth crosses the edge between the face it opened through and the face
//! next door has one, and it is the body the crossing repair already builds for
//! a bore carried out through a side wall — the moved carrier and the
//! neighbour split along their exact section, the overshoot dropped, and the
//! faces left holding an unanswered boundary RE-TRIMMED, which merges the mouth
//! into the outer loops of the two faces it now opens through.
//!
//! [`accept_or_break_out`] tries that before refusing, and the two cases are
//! told apart by GEOMETRY rather than by a threshold: the convicted hole loop
//! is traced in its own face's parameter plane and asked which of that face's
//! outer coedges it crosses ([`breakout_pair`]). A hole that has broken out
//! onto a neighbour crosses one, and the face across that edge is the one to
//! re-trim against. A hole that has left the body altogether crosses none, and
//! there is no second face for the repair to be about — so the runaway refuses
//! before a single face is split, and it refuses with the floor's own words
//! plus the repair's reason for declining.
//!
//! The extent is DERIVED and not invented, which is what makes this the same
//! repair rather than a new operation with a new input. The tool is the moved
//! carrier trimmed against the body, and where the carrier meets the body is
//! what the imprint computes. Measured on the 2026-09-21 exit-hole report: the
//! body this builds removes 4195.389267765 from the filled wedge, against
//! 4195.389268713 for the same wedge with the INFINITE moved carrier
//! subtracted through the boolean and 4195.389267095 for a slice integration
//! that never enters the kernel — three roads, 1.6e-9 apart.
//!
//! ## The order
//!
//! Three separate slices built [`accept_sound`]'s sequence on 2026-09-21 and
//! none of them saw the whole of it, so here it is end to end:
//!
//! 1. SCAN once. One tessellation, one BVH sweep; every verdict below is read
//!    off that single reading.
//! 2. NOT FLAGGED — [`accept_or_break_out`]: the hole-containment floor runs on
//!    the body as built, and the body is returned when it says nothing. When it
//!    convicts, the BREAKOUT is tried before the refusal — the same split and
//!    re-trim step 4 runs, on a pair the floor names instead of one the scan
//!    confirmed — and only a breakout that cannot be built refuses. This is the
//!    ONLY path a bore carried clear of its faces reaches, because a bore that
//!    has left the solid crosses nothing.
//! 3. FLAGGED — the body is dumped under `BREP_HEAL_DUMP`, and a FOLD refuses
//!    here and now: a fold is a trim that was never constructed, not material
//!    to drop.
//! 4. A CROSSING goes to [`resolve_face_crossing`], which returns the body
//!    UNCHANGED when nothing is confirmed, refuses a fold and refuses more than
//!    one crossing pair, and otherwise imprints the two carriers' section onto
//!    both faces and enumerates every way of dropping the resulting pieces —
//!    closed under `Drop` first, and under `Retrim` only where that resolved
//!    nothing at all.
//! 5. The repaired body is SCANNED AGAIN, and a repair that still
//!    self-intersects refuses, naming the original crossing.
//! 6. [`accept_or_break_out`] AGAIN, on the repaired body, so a re-trim that
//!    left a hole off its face is broken out in turn or refused, rather than
//!    shipped.
//!
//! Steps 4 and 6 bound each other, and the boundary is not a gap. The crossing
//! repair needs a section to split along, and a section exists exactly while
//! the moved carrier still MEETS the body; the containment floor decides what
//! is left. Measured on the 2026-09-21 runaway-bore report, the crossing
//! regime ends and the carrier's clearance turns positive in the SAME step of
//! a swept drag, and 13.90 mm past that the repair is handed a body with
//! nothing to imprint and hands it straight back.
//!
//! What step 2's breakout adds is the OTHER side of that boundary: the window
//! where the mouth has crossed its face's edge but the wall's overshoot is
//! still a sliver the tessellation cannot resolve, so the scan confirms
//! nothing and step 4 is never entered. On the reported document that window
//! is `s = 0.99 … 1.03` of the drag, and the scan takes over at `s = 1.04`.
//! The two routes reach the same [`split_and_drop`] and the repair is one
//! repair.
//!
//! ## Cost
//!
//! One tessellation and one BVH sweep per accepted result, and only on the
//! success path. Both verdicts come off that one scan. The containment floor
//! traces the loops of PLANAR faces that have more than one, in their own
//! parameters; a face with a single loop costs nothing.
//!
//! That note used to stop at that sentence, and stopping there was
//! misleading: the floor's cost was never in how MANY faces qualify but in
//! how LARGE one qualifying face's loops can be. A loop is traced at 32
//! stations per KNOT SPAN, so a box's face gives four points and an imported
//! 100-tooth gear's flat gives 1.1 MILLION; testing every hole point against
//! every one of those is a PRODUCT, and three such faces out of 1004 cost 24
//! s of a 30 s replay. The trace is unchanged — decimating it would weaken
//! the predicate — and the product is what went instead: the outer loop is
//! indexed once into bands of its own `v` ([`BoundaryBands`]) and each hole
//! point reads only the band it falls in, for the same answer at `hole
//! points × segments per band`.

///   would be measured against, so resolving them together is a different
///   problem from resolving one.
/// * A crossing whose carriers' intersection does not cut BOTH trims. Then the
///   mesh crossing is not a curve the faces share and there is nothing to split
///   along.
/// * More pieces than [`MAXIMUM_CROSSING_PIECES`], because every candidate drop
///   is rebuilt in full and the enumeration has to run to the end rather than
///   be sampled.
/// * Any split whose reassembly does not come back SOUND. Every way of dropping
///   some pieces of each face — keeping at least one of each — is enumerated,
///   closed under the re-trim, rebuilt and re-checked in full (`validate()`
///   clean, connected, and scanning clean), so the piece choice is decided by
///   the result rather than guessed from a normal. If none verifies, the solid
///   is returned untouched and the caller refuses: a repair that cannot prove
///   its own answer must not ship one.
/// * A split that MORE THAN ONE drop resolves. Two sound answers is not an
///   answer, and choosing between them would be the guess this repair exists
///   not to make.
///
/// **The re-trim is the other half of the split.** Dropping a tail also removes
/// that tail's boundary uses on the NEIGHBOURING faces it bordered, and a body
/// cannot close over an edge only one face answers for. So the drop is closed
/// under "a face left holding an unmatched boundary goes too" — which, since
/// the imprint already cut those neighbours where the crossing curve met their
/// edges, drops the part of each that the crossing cut off. The closure is
/// bounded by the faces the imprint TOUCHED: reaching any other face ends that
/// candidate. Nothing here edits a loop by hand; every piece it chooses between
/// came out of the imprint/fragment machinery.
///
/// **And the drop RETIRES what the old configuration left.** The touched bound
/// is about material the crossing encloses, and it does not reach the third
/// thing a moved carrier leaves on a body: a piece, or a whole loop, that the
/// NEW configuration has no room for — a bore's exit ring still recorded on the
/// top face after the exit has migrated onto the side. Neither is material this
/// drop ran past; both are held by nothing the drop keeps, and keeping either
/// cannot close. [`fragment_is_detached`] retires the one the fragmenter
/// returns as its own island and [`holds_only_stale_loops`] the one it returns

/// as its own island — which it does when the stale ring is far enough from the
/// face's own trim to be plainly disjoint. When it is nearer, the same ring
/// comes back as a HOLE LOOP of the face it left: the turned bore's exit ring
/// at 40 degrees sits at `x = 22.9 - 30.7` against a top face that ends at 20,
/// and the top face is ONE fragment carrying it. There is no island to retire,
/// and taking the loop off is a RE-TRIM of a face the imprint never cut.
///
/// That is the move the earlier records named as missing — *"the departed face
/// keeps a hole loop the imprint never cut, and the drop enumeration has no
/// move for retiring one"*. This is the move, and it is bounded FOUR ways:
///
/// * **Unanswered for.** Every non-degenerate edge of the loop is used once,
///   by this fragment alone, so no other face the drop keeps is standing on it
///   and removing it takes nothing from anyone. A loop only PART of which is
///   unanswered for is a genuine re-trim of a neighbour that bordered the
///   dropped material, and the [`touched`] bound still owns that case.
/// * **It has LEFT the face**, by the containment floor's own test: every
///   sample of it lies outside the face's outer loop in that face's own
///   parameter plane. This is the condition that matters, and it was added
///   after measuring what happens without it. Unanswered-for alone is
///   SYMMETRIC — at 40 degrees it licensed retiring the bore's ENTRY mouth
///   just as readily as its departed exit ring, so the enumeration verified
///   two bodies and refused the pair as ambiguous. A loop still inside its own
///   face is trimming material and is not a leftover, whoever is holding it.
/// * **A loop survives.** This never empties a face; a fragment with nothing
///   left at all is the detached case above.
/// * **A PLANE only**, as the containment floor restricts itself, because on a
///   periodic surface "outside the outer loop" in the parameter plane is a
///   statement about the seam rather than about the trim.
///
/// And the body still has to rebuild, `validate()`, connect, scan clean and
/// pass the containment floor afterwards, exactly as before.
