//! Standalone heal/sew — Golovanov's "sewing": assemble a valid oriented
//! shell out of faces whose boundary representations were built independently
//! (imported shells, detached face groups, healing after hand edits).
//!
//! The boolean assembler and the offset pipeline each carry private sewing
//! passes specialised to their own invariants (`sew_coincident_one_use_edges`
//! requires already-opposed traversals; the offset welds know their rims).
//! This module is the GENERAL entry: it pairs coincident one-use boundary
//! edges by geometry alone — open chains by matched endpoints + locus
//! agreement, closed rims by mutual locus agreement — WITHOUT any orientation
//! precondition, because a face soup's components may be arbitrarily flipped.
//! Orientation is repaired after pairing: coedge-direction coherence is
//! propagated across the now-shared edges and the whole solid is flipped
//! outward by signed volume.
//!
//! Sewing is BEST-EFFORT and honest: pairs that cannot be joined within
//! tolerance stay open and are counted in the report; nothing is force-welded.
